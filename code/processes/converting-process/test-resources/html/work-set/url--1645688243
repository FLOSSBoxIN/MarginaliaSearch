    <span style="color: #000000"></span>For my own part, I intend to show in this title essay that Benjamin Peirce's phyllotactic approach to the structure of the Solar system was essentially correct, all ramifications and consequences notwithstanding.
    <br> 
    <br><font style="color: #000000" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The full description of Benjamin Peirce's application of the Fibonacci series to the structure of the Solar System as published by Louis Agassiz is provided below; perhaps significantly, the words "Fibonacci" and "Golden Section" are noticeably absent -- such words perhaps already unacceptable to the powers that be and also a perceived threat to the <em>status quo</em>. Nevertheless, there can be no mistaking the sequence applied or the major premise, called here fittingly enough (for the moderns, at least) "the law of phyllotaxis". One may also note that Peirce had already considered the practical differences between his theoretical treatment and the Solar System itself and subsequently considered not only the position of Earth, but also discrepancies encountered for the positions of Mars, Uranus and Neptune. Initially Pierce also applied a double form of Fibonacci series but subsequently reduced the set to arrive are a situation similar to that involving the synodic difference cycle between adjacent planets.<br> That he did not examine the matter from this particular viewpoint in greater detail is the reason why this present essay exists.</font>

The normal series of fractions which expresses the various combinations most frequently observed among the leaves of plants is as follows:<strong>&nbsp; </strong><strong>1/2, 1/3, 2/5, 3/8, 5/13, 8/21, 13/34, 21/55</strong>, etc. Now upon comparing this arrangement of the leaves in plants with the revolutions of the members of our solar system, Peirce has discovered the most perfect identity between the fundamental laws which regulate both, as may be at once seen by the following diagram, in which the first column gives the names of the planets, the second column indicates the actual time of revolution of the successive planets, expressed in days; the third column, the successive times of revolution of the planets, which are derived from the hypothesis that each time of revolution should have a ratio to those upon each side of it, which shall be one of the ratios of the law of phyllotaxis; and the fourth column, finally, gives the normal series of fractions expressing the law of the phyllotaxis</small>.<small><small><sup>149</sup></small></small></big>&gt;&lt;&gt;

The explanation of this, suggested by Peirce, is that although the tendency to set off a planet is not sufficient at the end of a single interval, it becomes so strong near the end of the second interval that the planet is found exterior to the limit of this second interval. Thus, Uranus is rather too far from the Sun relatively to Neptune, Saturn relatively to Uranus, and Jupiter relatively to Saturn; and the planets thus formed engross too large a proportionate share of material, and this is especially the case with Jupiter. Hence, when we come to the Asteroids, the disposition is so strong at the end of a single interval, that the outer Asteroid is but just within this interval, and the whole material of the Asteroids is dispersed in separate masses over a wide space, instead of being concentrated into a single planet. A consequence of this dispersion of the forming agents is that a small proportionate material is absorbed into the Asteroids. Hence, Mars is ready for formation so far exterior to its true place, that when the next interval elapses the residual force becomes strong enough to form the Earth, after which the normal law is resumed without any further disturbance. Under this law there can be no planet exterior to Neptune, but there may be one interior to Mercury.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br style="color: #000000; font-family: times new roman,times,serif"> <span style="color: #000000; font-family: times new roman,times,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us now look back upon some of the leading features alluded to before, omitting the simpler relations of organized beings to the world around, or those of individuals to individuals, to consider only the different parallel series we have been comparing when showing that in their respective great types the phenomena of animal life correspond to one another, whether we compare their rank as determined by structural complication with the phases of their growth, or with their succession in past geological ages; whether we compare this succession with their embryonic growth, or all these different relations with each other and with the geographical distribution of animals upon earth. The same series everywhere! These facts are true of all the great divisions of the animal kingdom, so far as we have pursued the investigation; and though, for want of materials, the train of evidence is incomplete in some instances, yet we have proof enough for the establishment of this law of a universal correspondence in all the leading features which binds all organized beings of all times into one great system, intellectually and intelligibly linked together, even where some links of the chain are missing. It requires considerable familiarity with the subject even to keep in mind the evidence, for, though yet imperfectly understood, it is the most brilliant result of the combined intellectual efforts of hundreds of investigators during half a century. The connection, however, between the facts, it is easily seen, is only intellectual; and implies therefore the agency of Intellect as its first cause.</span></small> </big><small><sup style="color: #000000; font-family: times new roman,times,serif"><small><small>150</small></small></sup></small><big style="color: #000000"><small><strong style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif"><sup><br> </sup></strong><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; And if the power of thinking connectedly is the privilege of cultivated minds only; if the power of combining different thoughts and of drawing from them new thoughts is a still rarer privilege of a few superior minds; if the ability to trace simultaneously several trains of thought is such an extraordinary gift, that the few cases in which evidence of this kind has been presented have become a [p.131] matter of historical record (Caesar dictating several letters at the time), though they exhibit only the capacity of passing rapidly, in quick succession, from one topic to another, while keeping the connecting thread of several parallel thoughts: if all this is only possible for the highest intellectual powers, shall we by any false argumentation allow ourselves to deny the intervention of a Supreme Intellect in calling into existence combinations in nature, by the side of which all human conceptions are child's play? </span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif"> <span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp; If I have succeeded, even very imperfectly, in showing that the various relations observed between animals and the physical world, as well as between themselves, exhibit thought, it follows that the&nbsp; whole has an Intelligent Author; and it may not be out of place to attempt to point out, as far as possible, the difference there may be between Divine thinking and human thought. Taking nature as exhibiting thought for my guide, it appears to me that while human thought is consecutive, Divine thought is simultaneous, embracing at the same time and forever, in the past, the present, and the future, the most diversified relations among hundreds of thousands of organized beings, each of which may present complications again, which, to study and understand even imperfectly, as for instance, Man himself, Mankind has already spent thousands of years. And yet, all this has been done by one Mind, must be the work of one Mind only, of Him before whom Man can only bow in grateful acknowledgment of the prerogatives he is allowed to enjoy in this world, not to speak of the promises of a future life.</span><br style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif"> <span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have intentionally dismissed many points in my argument with mere questions, in order not to extend unduly a discussion which is after all only accessory to the plan of my work. I have felt justified in doing so because, from the point of view under which my subject is treated, those questions find a natural solution which must present itself to every reader. We know what the intellect of Man may originate, we know its creative power, its power of combination, of foresight, of analysis, of concentration; we are, therefore, prepared to recognize a similar action emanating from a Supreme Intelligence to a boundless extent. We need therefore not even attempt to show that such an Intellect may have originated all the Universe contains; it is enough to demonstrate that the constitution of the physical world and, more particularly, the organization of living beings in their connection with the physical world, prove in general the existence of a Supreme Being as the Author of all things. The task of science is rather to investigate what has been done, to inquire if possible how it has been done, than to ask what is possible for the Deity, as we can know that only by what actually exists. To attack such a position, those who would deny the intervention in nature of a creative mind must show that the cause to which they refer the origin of finite beings is by its nature a possible cause, which cannot be denied of a being endowed with the attributes we recognize in God. Our task is therefore completed as soon as we have proved His existence. It would nevertheless be highly desirable that every naturalist who has arrived at similar conclusions should go over the subject anew from his point of view and with particular reference to the special field of his investigations; for so only can the whole evidence be brought out. I foresee already that some of the most striking illustrations may be drawn from the morphology of the vegetable kingdom, especially from the characteristic succession and systematical combination of different kinds of leaves in the formation of the foliage and the flowers of so many plants, all of which end their development by the production of an endless variety of fruits. The inorganic world, "considered in the same light, would not fail to exhibit also unexpected evidence of thought, in the character of the laws regulating the chemical combinations, the action of physical forces, the universal attraction, etc., etc. Even the history of human culture ought to be investigated from this point of view. But I must leave it to abler hands to discuss such topics.</span></small> </big></font></p>

Animals are linked together as closely by their mode of development, by their relative standing in their respective classes, by the order in which they have made their appearance upon earth, by their geographical distribution, and generally by their connection with the world in which they live, as by their anatomy. All these relations should therefore be fully expressed in a natural classification; and though structure furnishes the most direct indication of some of these relations, always appreciable under every circumstance, other considerations should not be neglected which may complete our insight into the general plan of creation.&nbsp; </small></big></font><big><small><font style="color: #000000" face="Times New Roman,Times">(Louis Agassiz, <em>ESSAY&nbsp; ON CLASSIFICATION</em>,&nbsp; Ed.

Both utilized </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">Time</span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif"> (mean sidereal periods of revolution) rather than mean heliocentric</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif"> Distances</span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">, but my also own included the successive intermediate synodic periods (i.e., lap times) between adjacent planets.

     <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">Even so, c</span><big style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif"><small>omparisons between the Phi-Series planetary frameworks and the present Solar System were fraught with difficulty, not least of all because of three</small></big><span style="color: #000000; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif"> apparent anomalies: 1) the location of Earth in a synodic (i.e., intermediate) position between Venus and Mars; 2) the well-known "gap" between Mars and Jupiter, and 3), an "abnormal" location for Neptune, which produced an atypical synodic lap time for its inner neighbor, Uranus. Some may find the suggestion that Earth is occupying a synodic location uncomfortable, but at least the newly announced Dwarf planet status of Ceres accounts for the Mars-Jupiter gap reasonably enough, though Ceres remains but one asteroid among thousands in this region. <br> But in any event it is the location of Neptune that provides the key to Benjamin Peirce's far-reaching understanding of the matter. This I failed to comprehend when I first added the latter's material to Part VI owing to a basic difference in methodology. The inner starting point adopted by myself was perhaps always likely to produce the Pheidian Framework, but might not necessarily shed light on the final phyllotactic aspect. Starting from the opposite end, however, one<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">commences </span>with the latter, and with the larger fibonacci fractions applied by Peirce, one also moves with increasing accuracy towards the constant of linearity, <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Phi.</span> Thus starting from this direction was (in retrospect) always likely to be more productive. In one sense, however, Peirce's approach may have appeared almost too simplistic with divisions </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">involving periods of revolution expressed in days and the unexpected constant duplication of his divisors. The reason behind this latter occurrence is more complex than one might suspect since it is intimately related to intermediate synodic periods between adjacent pairs of planets. However, since the latter are simply obtained from the general synodic formula (the product of the two periods of revolution divided by their difference; see Part II), one can readily test the paired divisors applied Peirce from this particular viewpoint. Thus in </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">Table 1</span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif"> below the fibonacci fractions employed by Peirce are applied firstly to the mean period of revolution of Neptune (given here as </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">164.62423 years</span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">, i.e., Peirce's </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">60,129 days</span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif"> divided by</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">365.25 days</span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">).

But there is far more to this matter for the three resonant triples </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">1:1:2,</span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif"> </span><big style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif"><small><span style="font-weight: bold">1:2:3</span></small></big><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">and </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">2:3:5</span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif"> associated with the four superior planets Neptune, Uranus, Saturn and Jupiter are not only sequential, they are also successive </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">Fibonacci </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">triples bound together in a most complex manner.</span>
      <br style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif"> <span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif"> Before moving on to the last issue a question naturally arises whether an inner limit exists, and whether this might be determined. Even so, with Neptune "accounted for" there still remain two additional anomalous regions to complicate matters, but once again the elevation of Ceres to the status of Dwarf planet at least fills the next region below Jupiter, though still leaving the "anomalous" location of Earth to be resolved. Fortunately, however, the inclusion of Ceres provides two further sequential resonant triples (</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">3:5:8 </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">and</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">5:8:13 </span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">respectively) while the Phi-Series planetary framework also renders assistance below Mercury, since (in theoretical terms at least) it is only a matter of decreasing exponents by unity to move inwards as far as one wishes. In this manner it becomes possible to suggest that the resonant triples not only extend sequentially downwards from Neptune to Mercury (resonant triple </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">13:21:34</span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">) but also beyond Mercury to a specific </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">limit</span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif"> at the fifth inner position (final resonant triple of </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">144:233:377</span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">) as seen below in </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">Table 4</span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif"> for </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif">Phi-Series</span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif"> periods </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif"><span style="font-style: italic">Phi</span> <small><sup>5</sup></small></span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif"> through </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif"><span style="font-style: italic">Phi </span><small><sup>-13</sup></small></span><span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif"></span>

Remaining with the Phi-Series, Jay Kappraff </font><font style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">points out that the French architect Le Corbusier "</font><font style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">developed a linear scale of lengths based on the irrational number (phi), the golden mean, through the double geometric and Fibonacci (phi) series" for his Modular System. The latter's interest in the topic is explained further in the following informative passage from Kappraff's C</font><font style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><em>ONNECTIONS: The Geometric Bridge between Art and Science</em>:</font></p> 
     <div style="text-align: justify"> 
      <blockquote>
       <font face="Times New Roman,Times">As a young man, Le Coubusier studied the elaborate spiral patterns of stalks, or paristiches as they are called, on the surface of pine cones, sunflowers, pineapples, and other plants. This led him to make certain observations about plant growth that have been known to botanists for over a century.</font> 
       <br> <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Plants, such as sunflowers, grow by laying down leaves or stalks on an approximately planar surface. The stalks are placed successively around the periphery of the surface. Other plants such as pineapples or pinecones lay down their stalks on the surface of a distorted cylinder. Each stalk is displaced from the preceding stalk by a constant angle as measured from the base of the plant, coupled with a radial motion either inward or outward from the center for the case of the sunflower [see Figure 3.21 (b)] or up a spiral ramp as on the surface of the pineapple. The angular displacement is called the <em>divergence angle</em> and is related to the golden mean. The radial or vertical motion is measured by the pitch <strong><em>h</em></strong>. The dynamics of plant growth can be described by and <strong><em>h</em></strong>; we will explore this further in Section 6.9 [Coxeter, 1953].</font> 
       <br> <strong><em><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Each stalk lies on two nearly orthogonally intersecting logarithmic spirals, one clockwise and the other counterclockwise. The numbers of counterclockwise and clockwise spirals on the surface of the plants are generally successive numbers from the F series, but for some species of plants they are successive numbers from other Fibonacci series such as the Lucas series. These successive numbers are called the phyllotaxis numbers of the plant</font></em></strong><font face="Times New Roman,Times">. For example, <strong><em>there are 55 clockwise and 89 counterclockwise spirals lying on the surface of the sunflower; thus sunflowers are said to have 55, 89 phyllotaxis. On the other hand, pineapples are examples of 5, 8 phyllotaxis (although, since 13 counterclockwise spirals are also evident on the surface of a pineapple, it is sometimes referred to as 5, 8, 13 phyllotaxis</em></strong>). We will analyze the surface structure of the pineapple in greater detail in Section 6.9.</font> 
       <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3.7.2 <strong><em>Nature responds to a physical constraint </em></strong>After more than 100 years of study, just what causes plants to grow in accord with the dictates of Fibonacci series and the golden mean remains a mystery. However, recent studies suggest some promising hypotheses as to why such patterns occur [Jean, 1984], [Marzec and Kappraff, 1983], [Erickson, 1983].</font> <br> <font face="Times New Roman,Times">A model of plant growth developed by Alan Turing states that the elaborate patterns observed on the surface of plants are the consequence of a simple growth principle, namely, that new growth occurs in places "where there is the most room," and some kind of as-yet undiscovered growth hormone orchestrates this process. However, Roger Jean suggests that a phenomenological explanation based on diffusion is not necessary to explain phyllotaxis. Rather, the particular geometry observed in plants may be the result of minimizing an <em>entropy function</em> such as he introduces in his paper [1990].</font> <br> <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Actual measurements and theoretical considerations indicate that both Turing's diffusion model and Jean's entropy model are best satisfied when successive stalks are laid down at regular intervals of 2Pi /Phi<small><sup> 2</sup></small> radians, or<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold"> 137.5 degrees about a growth cente</span><strong><em>r</em></strong>, as Figure 3.22 illustrates for a celery plant. The centers of gravity of several stalks conform to this principle. One clockwise and one counterclockwise logarithmic spiral wind through the stalks giving an example of 1,1 phyllotaxis.</font> <br> <font face="Times New Roman,Times">The points representing the centers of gravity are projected onto the circumference of a circle in Figure 3.23, and points corresponding to the sequence of successive iterations of the divergence angle, 2Pi <em>n</em>/Phi<small><sup> 2</sup></small>, are shown for values of <em>n</em> from 1 to 10 placed in 10 equal sectors of the circle. Notice how the corresponding stalks are placed so that only one stalk occurs in each sector. This is a consequence of the following spacing theorem that is used by computer scientists for efficient parsing schemes [Knuth, 1980].</font> </p> 
       <blockquote>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Theorem 3.3 Let <em>x</em> be any irrational number. When the points [x] <sub>f,</sub> [2x] <sub>f,</sub> [3x] <sub>f,</sub>..., [<em>nx</em>] <sub>f </sub>are placed on the line segment [0,1], the<em> n</em> + 1 resulting line segments have at most three different lengths.</font> 
        <br> <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Moreover, [(<em>n</em> + 1)<em>x</em>]<sub>f </sub>will fall into one of the largest existing segments. ( [ ] <sub>f </sub>means "fractional part of ").</font>
       </blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Here clock arithmetic based on the unit interval, or mod 1 as mathematicians refer to it, is used, as shown in Figure 3.24, in place of the interval mod 2pi around the plant stem. It turns out that segments of various lengths are created and destroyed in a first-in-first-out manner. Of course, some irrational numbers are better than others at spacing intervals evenly. For example, an irrational that is near 0 or I will start out with many small intervals and one large one. Marzec and Kappraff [1983] have shown that the two numbers 1/Phi and 1/Phi<small><sup>2</sup></small> lead to the "most uniformly distributed" sequence among all numbers between Phi and 1. These numbers section the largest interval into the golden mean ratio,Phi :l, much as the blue series breaks the intervals of the red series in the golden ratio.</font> 
       <br> <strong><em><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thus nature provides a system for proportioning the growth of plants that satisfies the three canons of architecture (see Section 1.1). All modules (stalks) are isotropic (identical) and they are related to the whole structure of the plant through self-similar spirals proportioned by the golden mean. As the plant responds to the unpredictable elements of wind, rain, etc., enough variation is built into the patterns to make the outward appearance aesthetically appealing (nonmonotonous). This may also explain why Le Corbusier was inspired by plant growth to recreate some of its aspects as part of the Modulor system.</font></em></strong><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(Jay Kappraff, Chapter </font><em>3.7.

Some implications we may not wish to address; others we may prefer to ignore (if not deny), though I suggest that we can ill-afford to do so. For i</font><font style="color: #000000" face="Arial,Helvetica">f the Solar System is indeed phyllotactic, then it follows that there are wider implications to consider concerning the nature of not only "Life" as we understand it, but the nature of Humankind, our current behavioral traits and our role in the general scheme of things, assuming that we have one.<br> <br> We are at present, it seems, far too pleased with ourselves, and for far too little reason.<br> <br> But from a wider and larger "organic" perspective we surely need to consider where we ourselves are ultimately headed. And we also need to ask ourselves whether humankind exists in benign and symbiotic relationships with other living organisms (both near and far), or whether our behavior more resembles that of a parasitic infestation, even perhaps to the point of destroying our environment and ourselves. A harsh assessment? Perhaps so, but it is not un-called for in light of our virtually unchecked population growth, our ceaseless depredation of the environment and our worsening cycles of violence. So how indeed do we measure up from this wider and more complex perspective, and what might this augur for future expansion beyond planet Earth? Perhaps more pertinently still, when we ask the perennial question: "Are we Alone?" we might also be wise to ask ourselves </font><font style="color: #000000" face="Arial,Helvetica">whether </font><font style="color: #000000" face="Arial,Helvetica">we are always likely to remain so in view of our unsavoury past, troublesome present, and far from certain future. <br> <br></font><font style="color: #000000" face="Arial,Helvetica">Returning to the researches of Benjamin Peirce, i</font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">n retrospect it is hard to say how far his lines of inquiry might have been extended, or what might ultimately have resulted, but it must surely have been a far more useful endeavor than the circular, simplistic and <em>ad hoc</em> diversions introduced and perpetuated by "Bode's Law." H</font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">ow could something so momentous and far-reaching have been so easily driven into obscurity? According to the modern editor of Agassiz' <em style="font-weight: bold">Essay on Classification</em>, (E. Lurie) it was partly the work of Asa Gray and Chauncey Wright, as explained in the following footnote (the latter's No.149):</font> 
    <div style="text-align: justify"> 
     <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Agassiz tried to interest Americans in this concept, an idea typical of German speculative biology and one that he had been much impressed with since his student days at the University of Munich. See Asa Gray, "On the Composition of the Plant by Phytons, and Some Applications of Phyllotaxis," <em>Proceedings, AAAS,</em> II (<strong>1850</strong>), 438-444, and Benjamin Peirce, "Mathematical Investigations of the Fractions Which Occur in Phyllotaxis," in <strong><em>ibid</em></strong>., 444-447. Gray was never entirely convinced of the validity of this ideal conception.&nbsp; He subsequently encouraged Chauncey Wright to examine the problem of leaf arrangement, with the result that such facts were shown to be understandable in terms of the principle of natural selection.</font> </p>

    </div><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">but it is still incredible that it should have been driven down so swiftly, except, perhaps that it was undoubtedly heliocentric as well as a major departure from the views perpetuated by organized religion. Thus it may have come too late, a century after Linneaus' classifications, a little less with respect to Cook's voyages, and half a century or more of continued activity that was simply too much for those who wished to maintain the<em> status qu</em>o. Not that this was the only field affected where the Golden Section was concerned; it was also difficult for the likes of Canon Mosely and later others around the turn of the last century engaged in the analysis of spiral forms (especially applied to shells) as outlined in the closing </font>excerpt from <a href="../../llight.html">The Matter of lost Light:</a>

The above is included here because it epitomizes the darker, stumbling side of human progress. And also the realization that when Thomas Taylor (Introduction to<span style="font-weight: bold"></span><em style="font-weight: bold">Life and Theology of Orpheus</em>) speaks of social decline, loss of knowledge in ancient times and the efforts to preserve it by those who, <em>"though they lived in a base age"</em> nevertheless<em>"</em><em>happily fathomed the depth of their great master's works, luminously and copiously developed their recondite meaning, and benevolently communicated it in their writings for the general good,"</em> that sadly, such times are still upon us. Thus, just as Sir Theodore Andrea Cook,<small><small><sup>13</sup></small></small>who in the <em style="font-weight: bold">Curves of Life</em> (1914) was unable to define the "well known logarithmic spiral" equated in 1881 with the chemical elements (see the previous section:<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic"> Spira Solaris and the Three-fold number</span>), neither Canon Mosely<small><sup><small>14</small> </sup></small>nor Thompson were able write openly about the either the Golden Ratio or the Pheidian planorbidae. Nor unto the present day, it seems have others, for if not a forbidden subject <em>per se</em>, it long seems to have been a poor career choice, so to speak. Moreover, even after Louis Agassiz introduced Benjamin Peirce's phyllotaxic approach to structure of the Solar System in his <em style="font-weight: bold">Essay on Classification</em> (1857) the matter was swiftly dispatched and rarely referred to again. A possibly momentous shift in awareness, shunted aside with greatest of ease, as the editor of<em> Essay on Classification</em>, (E.

   <p style="text-align: justify"><font color="#000000" face="Arial,Helvetica"><span style="font-weight: bold">Abstract</span><br> Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion: T<sup>2</sup> = R<sup>3</sup> (T = period in years, R = mean distance in astronomical units) may be extended to include the inverse of the mean speed Vi (in units of the inverse of the Earth's mean orbital speed) such that: R = Vi<sup>2</sup> and T<sup>2</sup> = R<sup>3</sup> = Vi<sup> 6</sup>. The first relation - found in Galileo's last major work, the <em>Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences</em> (1638) - may also be restated and expanded to include relative speed Vr (in units of Earth's mean orbital speed k) and absolute speed Va = kVr. This paper explains the context of Galileo's velocity expansions of the laws of planetary motion and applies these relationships to the parameters of the Solar System. A related "percussive origins" theory of planetary formation is also discussed.</font></p>
