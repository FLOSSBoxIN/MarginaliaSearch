  <p>Plato is probably one of the greatest philosophers of all times, if not <i>the</i> greatest. Yet, he was one of the first philosophers, at least in the western philosophical tradition that was born in Greece a few hundred years BC., and anyway he is the first one whose complete works are still available to us. But if we have more than we would bargain for in terms of writings attributed to Plato, as some of the dialogues and letters transmitted to us under his name are obviously not his, we have very little data on his life and literary activity. As a result, many conflicting theories have been developed by scholars of various times regarding the interpretation of Plato's dialogues and their chronology to the extent it bears on that interpretation. This set of pages intends to present a new theory on the interpretation of Plato's dialogues and "philosophy". </p> 
  <p><img src="images/gnoti.jpg" width="300" height="159" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="10">But these pages don't intend to make you a Plato scholar, a specialist of his thoughts and "theories", for the simple reason that one of the most ingrained convictions of the author of these pages is that, if Plato wrote <b>dialogues</b> rather than philosophy treatises, and, what's more, dialogues in which he never stages himself as a participant, it is because his purpose was not to tell his readers what <i>he himself</i> thought, what were the answers <i>he himself</i> had given to the most fundamental questions in life about <b>what it means to be a (wo)man</b>, but to teach them <b>to think by themselves</b> so that they could find <i>their own answers</i> to those questions, because he knew that, in such matters, neither he nor we would ever get ultimate, "scientifically" demonstrable, answers, and that each one of us has to <b>build one's own life <i>and live it</i> </b>(and that, no one can do for someone else) based upon <b>hypotheses</b> that had to be the most "<b>reasonable</b>" that was possible, as what defines man is his being an animal endowed with <i>logos</i> (a Greek word meaning both "speech" and "reason", among many other meanings), but that would nonetheless remain till the end "indemonstrable" assumptions. In short, he only wanted to help his readers practice for themselves the motto that was engraved above the main entrance of the temple at Delphi, and which his "master", Socrates, had made his own:<br> </p>

  <p>(in Greek&nbsp;: "<em>gnôthi sauton</em>", which is better translated by "<em>come to know thyself</em>" or "<em>learn to know thyself</em>") and thus, to become <b>philosophers</b>, that is, according to Plato at least, not specialists of one scholarly branch of knowledge among others, making a living out of their teaching, peer debates and published works, but, in the etymological sense of the word, "lovers of wisdom", lovers (<i>philoi</i> in Greek) only, not "wise" (<i>sophoi</i> in Greek), because they know the wisdom they love cannot be reached in this life (as the principles upon which it depends cannot be demonstrated, which means, as Socrates used to say, that "I know nothing", meaning "I known nothing for certain, in the strongest sense of these words, nothing, that is, of what alone counts to reach happiness in life"), but constitutes an <b>idea(l) of <i>justice, </i></b>of a justice that is not merely abiding by the laws, but which is the <b>inner harmony</b> to be reached by a human being whose will is torn apart between passions and reason and whose unity is not given from the start, as the foundation for <b>social harmony</b> between men and women in the city.<br> </p>

   <li> a two-part article I wrote for the first issue of that journal ("<em>De la philosophie grecque</em>", published in two parts, the first part, "<a href="http://revue-klesis.org/numeros.html#d1p1" target="_blank"><em>De la philosophie grecque </em>(1)</a>", in February 2006 and the second part, "<a href="http://revue-klesis.org/numeros.html#d1p2" target="_blank"><em>De la philosophie grecque</em> (2)</a>", in April 2006) titled "<em>La fortune détournée de Platon, une étude sur le mot </em>ousia<em> dans les dialogues</em>" ("<em>The diverted wealth of Plato, a study on the word </em>ousia<em> in the dialogues</em>"). The <a href="http://revue-klesis.org/pdf/SuzanneFortuneDetourneePlaton1.pdf" target="_blank">first part of this article</a> (a <a href="fr/pdf/fortune_detournee_1.pdf">copy</a> of it is available on this site by <a href="fr/pdf/fortune_detournee_1.pdf">clicking here</a>, and <a href="fr/pdf/fortune_detournee_1_revison_2012-01.pdf">a revised version of it</a> taking into account the permutation between the <em>Gorgias</em> and the <em>Lesser Hippias</em> that I introduced in June, 2009 (for the reasons of this permutation, see<a href="tetra_2/tetra_2.htm#note20090606"> the opening note to the introduction of the second tetralogy</a>), is available by <a href="fr/pdf/fortune_detournee_1_revison_2012-01.pdf">clicking here</a>), subtitled "<em>Pour en finir avec Darwin chez Platon</em>" ("<em>To rid Plato of Darwin</em>"), is a synthetic presentation of my reading assumptions on the dialogues, as a prelude to the <a href="http://revue-klesis.org/pdf/SuzanneFortuneDetourneePlaton2.pdf" target="_blank">second part</a> (a <a href="fr/pdf/fortune_detournee_2.pdf">copy</a> of it is available on this site by <a href="fr/pdf/fortune_detournee_2.pdf">clicking here</a>), which constitutes the body of the article and where I show how the dual meaning of the word <em>ousia</em> in greek ("wealth, fortune", or else "estate"), in the original meaning, prior to the metaphysical meaning usually rendered by "essence" or "substance") may help us understand in which "metaphysical" meaning Plato used this word and what he means when, at the end of book VI of the <em>Republic</em>, he has Socrates say the the good is "<em>beyond</em><em> </em>ousias" (<a href="fr/tetra_4/republic/soleil.htm#p509b"><em>Republic</em>, VI, 509b9</a>);<br> &nbsp; </li> 
   <li>an article written by me and published in issue number 14, <em><a href="http://revue-klesis.org/numeros.html#d14" target="_blank">Varia</a></em>, dated February 2010, titled "<a href="http://revue-klesis.org/pdf/1-Varia-Suzanne.pdf" target="_blank"><strong><em>De la couleur avant toutes choses, les </em>schèmas<em> invisibles du </em>Ménon</strong></a>", and commenting on the examples of "definitions" given by Socrates to Meno in that part of the dialogue bearing his name that I have translated in French under the title "<a href="fr/tetra_3/meno/t73c_77a.htm"><em>Formes et couleurs</em></a>" (a local <a href="fr/pdf/de_la_couleur_avant_toute_chose.pdf">copy</a> of this article is available on this site by <a href="fr/pdf/de_la_couleur_avant_toute_chose.pdf">clicking here</a>).</li>

  <p>This site on Plato and his dialogues was made possible by the suggestion and encouragement the author received, and continues receiving, from <a href="http://www.evansville.edu/~tb2/">Anthony F. Beavers</a>, Associate Professor of Philosophy and Religion at the University of Evansville, Indiana, who accepted to host these pages for more than five years (May, 1996 to September, 2001) on one of the servers of the Internet Applications Laboratory (IALab) he founded and heads at the University of Evansville. Among many projects of the IALab, Tony is developing his own site on Plato, called "<a href="http://plato.evansville.edu/">Exploring Plato's Dialogues&nbsp;: A Virtual Learning Environment on the World-Wide Web</a>". </p>
