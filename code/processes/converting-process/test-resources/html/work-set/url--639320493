Most of this knowledge comes directly from or is<br> a result of my own research into the TOP SECRET/MAJIC<br> material which I personally saw and read between the years<br> 1970 and 1973 as a member of the Intelligence Briefing Team<br> of the Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet. Since some<br> of this information was derived from sources that I cannot<br> divulge for obvious reasons, and from published sources which<br> I personally cannot vouch for, this paper must be treated as<br> a hypothesis. Although, I firmly believe that this is the<br> true nature of the Beast. It is the only scenario that has<br> been able to cohesively bind all the diverse elements which<br> have been driving researchers to tears in their quest for<br> answers. It is the only scenario that answers all the<br> questions and places the various fundamental mysteries in an<br> arena that makes sense</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> It is the only explanation which<br> shows the chronology of events and shows that the different<br> chronologies when assembled together match perfectly.

These events were so incredible that<br> they defied belief. A stunned President Truman and his top<br> Military Commanders found themselves virtually impotent after<br> having just won the most devastating and costly war in<br> history. The United States had developed, used, and was the<br> only nation on earth in possession of the Atomic Bomb which<br> alone had the potential to destroy any enemy, and even the<br> Earth itself. At that time the United States had the best<br> economy, the most advanced technology, the highest standard<br> of living, exerted the most influence, and fielded the<br> largest and most powerful military forces in history. We can<br> only imagine the confusion and concern when the informed<br> elite of the United States Government discovered that an<br> alien spacecraft piloted by insect-like beings from a totally<br> incomprehensible culture had crashed in the desert of New<br> Mexico.<br> <br> Between January 1947 and December 1952 at least 16 crashed or<br> downed alien craft, 65 alien bodies, and 1 live alien were<br> recovered. An additional alien craft had exploded and<br> nothing was recovered from that incident. Of these<br> incidents, 13 occurred within the borders of the United<br> States not including the craft which disintegrated in the<br> air. Of these 13, 1 was in Arizona, 11 were in New Mexico,<br> and 1 was in Nevada. Three occurred in foreign countries.<br> Of those 1 was in Norway, and the last 2 were in Mexico.<br> Sightings of UFOS were so numerous that serious investigation<br> and debunking of each report became impossible utilizing the<br> existing intelligence assets.<br> <br> An alien craft was found on February 13, 1948 on a Mesa near<br> Aztec New Mexico. Another craft was located on March 25,<br> 1948 in Hart Canyon near Aztec New Mexico. It was 100 feet<br> in diameter. A total of 17 alien bodies were recovered from<br> those two craft. Of even greater significance was the<br> discovery of a large number of human body parts stored within<br> both of these vehicles. A demon had reared its ugly head and<br> paranoia quickly took hold of everyone then 'in the know'.<br> The Secret lid immediately became an Above Top Secret lid and<br> was screwed down tight. The security blanket was even<br> tighter than that imposed upon the Manhattan Project. In the<br> coming years these events were to become the most closely<br> guarded secrets in the history of the world.<br> <br> A special group of America's top scientists were organized<br> under the name Project Sign in December of 1947 to study the<br> phenomenon. The whole nasty business was contained within<br> the shroud of secrecy. Project Sign evolved into Project<br> Grudge in December of 1948. A low level collection and<br> disinformation project named Blue Book was formed under<br> Grudge</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> 16 volumes were to come out of Grudge including the<br> controversial "Grudge 13" which I and Bill English saw, read,<br> and revealed to the public. "Blue Teams" were put together<br> to recover the crashed discs and dead or alive aliens. The<br> Blue Teams were later to evolve into Alpha Teams under<br> Project Pounce</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><br> <br> <font size="3">During these early years the United States Air Force and the<br> Central Intelligence Agency exercised complete control over<br> the Alien Secret. In fact the CIA was formed by Presidential<br> Executive Order first as the Central Intelligence Group for<br> the express purpose of dealing with the alien presence</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><br> <font size="3">Later the National Security Act was passed establishing it as<br> the Central Intelligence Agency. The National Security<br> Council was established to oversee the intelligence community<br> and especially the alien endeavor. A series of National<br> Security Council Memos and Executive Orders removed the CIA<br> from the sole task of gathering foreign intelligence and<br> slowly but thoroughly 'legalized' direct action in the form<br> of covert activities at home and abroad.<br> <br> On December 9, 1947 Truman approved issuance of NSC-4,<br> entitled "Coordination of Foreign Intelligence Information<br> Measures" at the urging of Secretaries Marshall, Forrestal,<br> Patterson, and the director of the State Department's Policy<br> Planning Staff, Kennan.<br> <br> The Foreign and Military Intelligence, Book 1, "Final Report<br> of the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with<br> Respect to Intelligence Activities." United States Senate,<br> 94th Congress, 2nd Session, Report No. 94-755, April 26,<br> 1976, p. 49 states: "This directive empowered the secretary<br> of state to coordinate overseas information activities<br> designed to counter communism. A top secret annex to NSC-4,<br> NSC-4A, instructed the director of Central Intelligence to<br> undertake covert psychological activities in pursuit of the<br> aims set forth in NSC-4. The initial authority given the CIA<br> for covert operations under NSC-4A did not establish formal<br> procedures for either coordinating or approving these<br> operations. It simply directed the DCI to "undertake covert<br> actions and to ensure, through liaison with State and<br> Defense, that the resulting operations were consistent with<br> American policy."<br> <br> Later NSC-10/1 and NSC-10/2 were to supersede NSC-4 and NSC-<br> 4A and expand the covert abilities even further. The Office<br> of Policy Coordination (OPC) was chartered to carry out an<br> expanded program of covert activities. NSC-10/1 and NSC-10/2<br> validated illegal and extra-legal practices and procedures as<br> being agreeable to the national security leadership. The<br> reaction was swift. In the eyes of the intelligence<br> community "no holds were barred". Under NSC-10/1 an<br> Executive Coordination Group, was established to review, but<br> not approve, covert project proposals. The ECG was secretly<br> tasked to coordinate the alien projects. NSC-10/1 &amp; /2 were<br> interpreted to mean that no one at the top wanted to know<br> about anything until it was over and successful. These<br> actions established a buffer between the President and the<br> information. It was intended that this buffer serve as a<br> means for the President to deny knowledge if leaks divulged<br> the true state of affairs. This buffer was used in later<br> years for the purpose of effectively isolating succeeding<br> Presidents from any knowledge of the alien presence other<br> than what the Secret Government and the intelligence<br> community wanted them to know. NSC-10/2 established a study<br> panel which met secretly and was made up of the scientific<br> minds of the day. The study panel was not called MJ-12.<br> Another NSC memo, NSC-10/5 further outlined the duties of the<br> study panel. these NSC memos and secret Executive Orders set<br> the stage for the creation of MJ-12 only 4 years later.<br> <br> Secretary of Defense James Forrestal began to object to the<br> secrecy. He was a very idealistic and religious man who<br> believed that the public should be told. When he began to<br> talk to leaders of the opposition party and leaders of the<br> Congress about the alien problem he was asked to resign by<br> Truman. He expressed his fears to many people and rightfully<br> believed that he was being watched. This was interpreted by<br> those who were ignorant of the facts as paranoia. Forrestal<br> later was said to have suffered a mental breakdown and was<br> admitted to Bethesda Naval Hospital. In fact it was feared<br> that Forrestal would begin to talk again and he had to be<br> isolated and discredited. Sometime in the early morning of<br> May 22, 1949 agents of the CIA tied a sheet around his neck,<br> fastened the other end to a fixture in his room and threw<br> James Forrestal out the window. The sheet tore and he<br> plummeted to his death. He became one of the first victims<br> of the cover-up.<br> <br> The live alien that had been taken from the 1949 Roswell<br> crash was named EBE. The name had been suggested by Dr.<br> Vannever Bush and was short for Extraterrestrial Biological<br> Entity. EBE had a tendency to lie and for over a year would<br> give only the desired answer to questions asked. Those<br> questions which would have resulted in an undesirable answer<br> went unanswered. At some point during the second year of<br> captivity he began to open up and the information derived<br> from EBE was startling to say the least. This compilation of<br> his revelations became the foundation of what would later be<br> called the "Yellow Book". Photographs were taken of EBE<br> which, among others, I and Bill English were to view years<br> later in GRUDGE 13.<br> <br> In late 1951 EBE became ill. Medical personnel had been<br> unable to determine the cause of EBE's illness and had no<br> background from which to draw. EBE's system was chlorophyll<br> based and he processed food into energy much the same as<br> plants. Waste material was excreted the same as plants. It<br> was decided that an expert in botany was called for. A<br> botanist, Dr. Guillermo Mendoza, was brought in to try and<br> help him recover. Dr. Mendoza worked to save EBE until<br> mid 1952 when EBE died. Dr. Mendoza became the expert on<br> alien biology.<br> <br> In a futile attempt to save EBE and to gain favor with this<br> technologically superior alien race the United States began<br> broadcasting a call for help early in 1952 into the vast<br> regions of space</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> The call went unanswered but the project<br> continued as an effort of good faith.<br> <br> President Truman created the super secret National Security<br> Agency by secret Executive Order on November 4, 1952. Its<br> primary purpose was to decipher the alien communications and<br> language and establish a dialog with the aliens. This most<br> urgent task was a continuation of the earlier effort and was<br> code named SIGMA. The secondary purpose of the NSA was to<br> monitor all communications and emissions from any and all<br> devices worldwide for the purpose of gathering intelligence,<br> both human and alien, and to contain the secret of the alien<br> presence</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> Project Sigma was successful. The NSA also<br> maintains communications with the Luna base and other Secret<br> Space Programs. By Executive Order The NSA is exempt from<br> all laws which do not specifically name the NSA in the text<br> of the law as being subject to that law. That means that if<br> the agency is not spelled out in the text of any and every<br> law passed by the Congress it is not subject to that or those<br> laws. The NSA now performs many other duties and in fact is<br> the premier agency within the intelligence community. Today<br> the NSA receives 75% of the moneys allotted to the<br> intelligence community. The old saying "where the money goes<br> therein the power resides is true</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> The DCI today is a<br> figurehead maintained as a public ruse</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> The primary task of<br> the NSA is still alien communications but now includes other<br> Alien projects as well.<br> <br> President Truman had been keeping our allies, including the<br> Soviet Union, informed of the developing alien problem since<br> the Roswell recovery. This had been done in case the aliens<br> turned out to be a threat to the human race</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> Plans were<br> formulated to defend the Earth in case of invasion. Great<br> difficulty was encountered in maintaining international<br> secrecy. It was decided that an outside group was necessary<br> to coordinate and control international efforts in order to<br> hide the secret from the normal scrutiny of governments by<br> the press. The result was the formation of a secret society<br> which became known as the "Bilderburgers". The headquarters<br> of this group is Geneva, Switzerland. The Bilderburgers<br> evolved into a secret world government that now controls<br> everything. The United Nations was then, and is now, an<br> international joke</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><br> <br> <font size="3">In 1953 a new president occupied the White House</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> He was a<br> man used to a structured staff organization with a chain of<br> command. His method was to delegate authority and rule by<br> committee</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> He made major decisions but only when his<br> advisors were unable to come to consensus. His normal method<br> was to read through or listen to several alternatives and<br> then approve one</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> Those who worked closely with him have<br> stated that his favorite comment was, "just do whatever it<br> takes". He spent a lot of time on the golf course</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> This was<br> not at all unusual for a man who had been career Army with<br> the ultimate position of Supreme Allied Commander during the<br> war. A post which carried 5 stars along with it. This<br> President was General of the Army Dwight David Eisenhower.<br> <br> During his first year in office, 1953, at least 10 more<br> crashed discs were recovered along with 26 dead and 4 live<br> aliens. Of the 10, 4 were found in Arizona, 2 in Texas, 1 in<br> New Mexico, 1 in Louisiana, 1 in Montana, and 1 in South<br> Africa. There were hundreds of sightings.<br> <br> Eisenhower knew that he had to wrestle and beat the alien<br> problem. He knew that he could not do it by revealing the<br> secret to the Congress. Early in 1953 the new President<br> turned to his friend and fellow member of the Council on<br> Foreign Relations Nelson Rockefeller for help with the alien<br> problem. Eisenhower and Rockefeller began planning the<br> secret structure of alien task supervision which was to<br> become a reality within 1 year. The idea for MJ-12 was thus<br> born. It was Nelson's Uncle Winthrop Aldrich who had been<br> crucial in convincing Eisenhower to run for President. The<br> whole Rockefeller family and with them the Rockefeller empire<br> had solidly backed Ike</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> Asking Rockefeller for help with the<br> alien problem was to be the biggest mistake Eisenhower ever<br> made for the future of the United States and most probably<br> all of humanity.<br> <br> Within 1 week of Eisenhower's election he had appointed<br> Nelson Rockefeller chairman of a Presidential Advisory<br> Committee on Government Organization. Rockefeller was<br> responsible for planning the reorganization of the<br> government. New Deal programs went into 1 single Cabinet<br> position called the Department of Health, Education, and<br> Welfare</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> When the Congress approved the new Cabinet position<br> in April of 1953, Nelson was named to the post of<br> Undersecretary to Oveta Culp Hobby.<br> <br> In 1953 Astronomers discovered large objects in space which<br> were moving toward the Earth. It was first believed that<br> they were asteroids. Later evidence proved that the objects<br> could only be Spaceships. Project Sigma intercepted alien<br> radio communications. When the objects reached the Earth<br> they took up a very high orbit around the Equator. There<br> were several huge ships, and their actual intent was unknown.<br> Project Sigma, and a new project, Plato, through radio<br> communications using the computer binary language, was able<br> to arrange a landing that resulted in face to face contact<br> with alien beings from another planet. Project Plato was<br> tasked with establishing diplomatic relations with this race<br> of space aliens.<br> <br> In the meantime a race of human looking aliens contacted the<br> U.S. Government. This alien group warned us against the<br> aliens that were orbiting the Equator and offered to help us<br> with our spiritual development. They demanded that we<br> dismantle and destroy our nuclear weapons as the major<br> condition. They refused to exchange technology citing that<br> we were spiritually unable to handle the technology which we<br> then possessed. They believed that we would use any new<br> technology to destroy each other. This race stated that we<br> were on a path of self destruction and we must stop killing<br> each other, stop polluting the Earth, stop raping the Earth's<br> natural resources, and learn to live in harmony. These terms<br> were met with extreme suspicion, especially the major<br> condition of nuclear disarmament. It was believed that<br> meeting that condition would leave us helpless in the face of<br> an obvious alien threat. We also had nothing in history to<br> help with the decision. Nuclear disarmament was not<br> considered to be within the best interest of the United<br> States. The overtures were rejected.<br> <br> Later in 1954 the race of large nosed Gray Aliens which had<br> been orbiting the Earth landed at Holloman Air Force Base</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> A<br> basic agreement was reached. This race identified themselves<br> as originating from a Planet around a red star in the<br> Constellation of Orion which we called Betelgeuse</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> They<br> stated that their planet was dying and that at some unknown<br> future time they would no longer be able to survive there</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><br> <font size="3">This led to a second landing at Edwards Air Force Base</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> The<br> historical event had been planned in advance and details of<br> the treaty had been agreed upon. Eisenhower arranged to be<br> in Palm Springs on vacation. On the appointed day the<br> President was spirited away to the base and the excuse was<br> given to the press that he was visiting a dentist.<br> <br> President Eisenhower met with the aliens and a formal treaty<br> between the Alien Nation and the United States of America was<br> signed. We then received our first Alien Ambassador from<br> outer space</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> His name and title was His "Omnipotent Highness<br> Krlll", pronounced Krill. In the American tradition of<br> distain for royal titles he was secretely called "Original<br> Hostage Krlll". You should know that the Alien flag is known<br> as the "Trilateral Insignia" and is displayed on their craft<br> and worn on their uniforms. Both of these landings and the<br> second meeting were filmed. These films exist today.<br> <br> The treaty stated: The aliens would not interfere in our<br> affairs and we would not interfere in theirs. We would keep<br> their presence on earth a secret. They would furnish us with<br> advanced technology and would help us in our technological<br> development. They would not make any treaty with any other<br> earth nation. They could abduct humans on a limited and<br> periodic basis for the purpose of medical examination and<br> monitoring of our development with the stipulation that the<br> humans would not be harmed, would be returned to their point<br> of abduction, that the humans would have no memory of the<br> event, and that the Alien nation would furnish MJ-12 with a<br> list of all human contacts and abductees on a regularly<br> scheduled basis. It was agreed that each nation would<br> receive the Ambassador of the other for as long as the treaty<br> remained in force</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> It was further agreed that the Alien<br> nation and the United States would exchange 16 personnel each<br> to the other with the purpose of learning, each of the other.<br> The Alien "Guests" would remain on earth and the human<br> "Guests" would travel to the Alien point of origin for a<br> specified period of time then return, at which point a<br> reverse exchange would be made</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> It was also agreed that<br> bases would be constructed underground for the use of the<br> Alien nation and that 2 bases would be constructed for the<br> joint use of the Alien nation and the United States<br> Government. Exchange of technology would take place in the<br> jointly occupied bases. These Alien bases would be<br> constructed under Indian reservations in the 4 corners of<br> Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and 1 would be<br> constructed in Nevada in the area known as S-4 located<br> approximately 7 miles south of the western border of Area 51,<br> known as Dreamland. All alien areas are under complete<br> control of the Naval Department and all personnel who work in<br> these complexes receive their checks from the Navy.<br> Construction of the bases began immediately but progress was<br> slow until large amounts of money were made available in<br> 1957. Work continued on the "Yellow Book".<br> <br> Project REDLIGHT was formed and experimentation in test<br> flying alien craft was begun in earnest. A super TOP SECRET<br> facility was built at Groom Lake in Nevada in the midst of<br> the weapons test range</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> It was code named DREAMLAND. The<br> installation was placed under the Department of the Navy and<br> clearance of all personnel required a "Q" clearance as well<br> as Executive (Presidential) approval. This is ironic due to<br> the fact that the President of the United States does not<br> have clearance to visit the site</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> The alien base and<br> exchange of technology actually took place in an Area known<br> as S-4. Area S-4 was code named "The Dark Side of the Moon".<br> <br> The Army was tasked to form a super secret organization to<br> furnish security for all alien tasked projects. This<br> organization became the National Reconnaissance Organization<br> based at Fort Carson, Colorado. The specific teams trained<br> to secure the projects were called Delta.<br> <br> A second project code named SNOWBIRD was promulgated to<br> explain away any sightings of the REDLIGHT crafts as being<br> Air Force experiments. The SNOWBIRD crafts were manufactured<br> using conventional technology and were flown for the press on<br> several occasions. Project SNOWBIRD was also used to debunk<br> legitimate public sightings of alien craft (UFOS). Project<br> SNOWBIRD was very successful and reports from the public<br> declined steadily until recent years.<br> <br> A multimillion-dollar SECRET fund was organized and kept by<br> the Military Office of the White House</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> This fund was used<br> to build over 75 deep underground facilities. Presidents who<br> asked were told the fund was used to build Deep Underground<br> Shelters for the President in case of war. Only a few were<br> built for the President. Millions of dollars were funnelled<br> through this office to MJ-12 and then out to the contractors<br> and was used to build TOP SECRET alien bases as well as TOP<br> SECRET DUMB (Deep Underground Military Bases), and the<br> facilities promulgated by "Alternative 2", throughout the<br> nation. President Johnson used this fund to build a movie<br> theater and pave the road on his ranch. He had no idea of<br> its true purpose</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><br> <br> <font size="3">The secret White House underground construction fund was set<br> up in 1957 by President Eisenhower. The funding was obtained<br> from Congress under the guise of "construction and<br> maintenance of secret sites where the President could be<br> taken in case of military attack: Presidential Emergency<br> Sites". The sites are literally holes in the ground, deep<br> enough to withstand a nuclear blast and are outfitted with<br> state of the art communications equipment. To date there are<br> more than seventy-five sites spread around the country which<br> were built using money from this fund. The Atomic Energy<br> Commission has built at least an additional 22 underground<br> sites.<br> <br> The location and everything to do with these sites were and<br> are considered and treated as TOP SECRET. The money was and<br> is in control of the Military Office of the White House, and<br> was and is laundered through a circuitous web that even the<br> most knowledgeable spy or accountant can not follow. As of<br> 1980 only a few at the beginning and end of this web knew<br> what the money was for. At the beginning were Representative<br> George Mahon, of Texas, the chairman of the House<br> Appropriations Committee and of its Defense Subcommittee; and<br> Representative Robert Sikes, of Florida, chairman of the<br> House Appropriations Military Construction Subcommittee</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><br> <font size="3">Today it is rumored that House Speaker Jim Wright controls<br> the money in Congress and that a power struggle is underway<br> to remove him. At the end of the line were the President,<br> MJ-12, the director of the Military Office and a commander at<br> the Washington Navy Yard.<br> <br> The money was authorized by the Appropriations Committee who<br> allocated it to the Department of Defense as a TOP SECRET<br> item in the Army construction program. The Army, however<br> could not spend it and in fact did not even know what it was<br> for. Authorization to spend the money was in reality given<br> to the Navy. The money was channeled to the Chesapeake<br> Division of the Navy Engineers who did not know what it was<br> for either. Not even the Commanding Officer, who was an<br> Admiral, knew what the fund was to be used for. Only one<br> man, a Navy Commander, who was assigned to the Chesapeake<br> Division but in reality was responsible only to the Military<br> Office of the White House knew of the actual purpose, amount,<br> and ultimate destination of the TOP SECRET fund. The total<br> secrecy surrounding the fund meant that almost every trace of<br> it could be made to disappear by the very few people who<br> controlled it. There has never been and most likely never<br> will be an audit of this secret money.<br> <br> Large amounts of money were transferred from the TOP SECRET<br> fund to a location at Palm Beach, Florida that belongs to the<br> Coast Guard called Peanut Island. The island is adjacent to<br> property which was owned by Joseph Kennedy. The money was<br> said to have been used for landscaping and general<br> beautification. Some time ago a TV news special on the<br> Kennedy assassination told of a Coast Guard Officer<br> transferring money in a briefcase to a Kennedy employee<br> across this property line</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> Could this have been a secret<br> payment to the Kennedy family for the loss of their son John<br> F. Kennedy? The payments continued through the year 1967<br> and then stopped. The total amount transferred is unknown<br> and the actual use of the money is unknown.<br> <br> Meanwhile, Nelson Rockefeller changed positions again. This<br> time he was to take C. D. Jackson's old position which had<br> been called the Special Assistant for Psychological Strategy.<br> With Nelson's appointment the name was changed to the Special<br> Assistant for Cold War Strategy. This position would evolve<br> over the years into the same position Henry Kissinger was<br> ultimately to hold under President Nixon. Officially he was<br> to give "Advice and assistance in the development of<br> increased understanding and cooperation among all peoples".<br> The official description was a smoke screen for secretly he<br> was the Presidential Coordinator for the Intelligence<br> Community. In his new post Rockefeller reported directly,<br> and only, to the President. He attended meetings of the<br> Cabinet, the Council on Foreign Economic Policy, and the<br> National Security Council which was the highest policy-making<br> body in the government.<br> <br> Nelson Rockefeller was also given a second important job as<br> the head of the secret unit called the Planning Coordination<br> Group which was formed under NSC 5412/1 in March of 1955.<br> The group consisted of different ad hoc members depending on<br> the subject on the agenda. The basic members were<br> Rockefeller, A representative of the Department of Defense, A<br> representative of the Department of State, and the Director<br> of Central Intelligence</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> It was soon called the "5412<br> Committee" or the "Special Group". NSC 5412/1 established<br> the rule that covert operations were subject to approval by<br> an executive committee, whereas in the past these operations<br> were initiated solely on the authority of the Director of<br> Central Intelligence</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><br> <br> <font size="3">By secret Executive Memorandum, NSC 5410, Eisenhower had<br> preceeded NSC 5412/1 in 1954 to establish a permanent<br> committee (not ad hoc) to be known as Majority Twelve (MJ-12)<br> to oversee and conduct all covert activities concerned with<br> the alien question. NSC 5412/1 was created to explain the<br> purpose of these meetings when Congress and the Press became<br> curious. Majority Twelve was made up of Nelson Rockefeller,<br> the Director of Central Intelligence Allen Welsh Dulles, the<br> Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, the Secretary of<br> Defense Charles E. Wilson, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs<br> of Staff Admiral Arthur W. Radford, the Director of the<br> Federal Bureau of Investigation J. Edgar Hoover, and six men<br> from the executive committee of the Council on Foreign<br> Relations known as the "Wise Men". These men were all<br> members of a secret society of scholars that called<br> themselves "The Jason Society", or "The Jason Scholars" who<br> recruited their members from the "Skull and Bones" and the<br> "Scroll and Key" societies of Harvard and Yale</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><br> <br> <font size="3">The "Wise Men" were key members of the Council on Foreign<br> Relations. There were 12 members including the first 6 from<br> Government positions thus Majority Twelve</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> This group was<br> made up over the years of the top officers and directors of<br> the Council on Foreign Relations and later the Trilateral<br> Commission. Gordon Dean, George Bush and Zbigniew Brzezinski<br> were among them. The most important and influential of the<br> "Wise Men" who served on MJ-12 were John McCloy, Robert<br> Lovett, Averell Harriman, Charles Bohlen, George Kennan, and<br> Dean Acheson. Their policies were to last well into the<br> decade of the 70s. It is significant that President<br> Eisenhower as well as the first 6 MJ-12 members from the<br> Government were also members of the Council on Foreign<br> Relations.<br> <br> Thorough researchers will soon discover that not all of the<br> "Wise Men" attended Harvard or Yale and not all of them were<br> chosen for "Skull and Bones" or "Scroll and Key" membership<br> during their college years. You will be able to quickly<br> clear up this mystery by obtaining the book "The Wise Men" by<br> Walter Isaacson &amp; Evan thomas, Simon and Schuster, New York.<br> Under illustration #9 in the center of the book you will find<br> the caption; "Lovett with the Yale Unit, above far right, and<br> on the beach: His initiation into Skull and Bones came at an<br> air base near Dunkirk". I have found that members were<br> chosen on an ongoing basis by invitation based upon merit<br> post college and was not confined to only Harvard or Yale<br> attendees.<br> <br> A chosen few were later initiated into the Jason Society.<br> They are all members of the Council on Foreign Relations and<br> at that time were known as the "Eastern Establishment". This<br> should give you a clue to the far reaching and serious nature<br> of these most secret college societies. The society is alive<br> and well today but now includes members of the Trilateral<br> Commission as well. The Trilateralists existed secretly<br> several years BEFORE 1973. The name of the Trilateral<br> Commission was taken from the alien flag known as the<br> Trilateral Insignia.<br> <br> Majority Twelve was to survive right up to the present day.<br> Under Eisenhower and Kennedy it was erroniously called the<br> "5412 Committee" or more correctly the "Special Group". In<br> the Johnson Administration it became the "303 Committee"<br> because the name 5412 had been compromised in the book "The<br> Secret Government". Actually NSC 5412/1 was leaked to the<br> author to hide the existence of NSC 5410. Under Nixon, Ford,<br> and Carter it was called the "40 Committee", and under Reagan<br> it became the "PI-40 Committee". Over all those years only<br> the name changed.<br> <br> By 1955 it became obvious that the aliens had deceived<br> Eisenhower and had broken the treaty. Mutilated humans were<br> being found along with mutilated animals all across the<br> United States. It was suspected that the aliens were not<br> submitting a complete list of human contacts and abductees to<br> MJ-12 and it was suspected that not all abductees had been<br> returned. The Soviet Union was suspected of interacting with<br> them and this proved to be true</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> It was learned that the<br> aliens had been and were then manipulating masses of people<br> through secret societies, witchcraft, magic, the occult, and<br> religion. After several Air Force combat air engagements<br> with alien craft it also became apparent that our weapons<br> were no match against them.<br> <br> In November of 1955 NSC-5412/2 was issued establishing a<br> study committee to explore "all factors which are involved in<br> the making and implementing of foreign policy in the nuclear<br> age". This was only a blanket of snow that covered the real<br> subject of study, the alien question.<br> <br> By secret Executive Memorandum, NSC 5411 in 1954, President<br> Eisenhower had commissioned the study group to "examine all<br> the facts, evidence, lies, and deception and discover the<br> truth of the alien question". NSC 5412/2 was only a cover<br> that had become necessary when the press began inquiring as<br> to the purpose of regular meetings of such important men.<br> The first meetings began in 1954 and were called the Quantico<br> meetings because they met at the Quantico Marine Base</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> The<br> study group was made up solely of 35 members of the Council<br> on Foreign Relations' secret scholars known as "The Jason<br> Society" or "The Jason Scholars". Dr. Edward Teller was<br> invited to participate</font><a href="http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/speech1.html"><font size="3">.</font></a><font size="3"> Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski was the<br> Study Director for the first 18 months. Dr. Henry Kissinger<br> was chosen as the groups Study Director for the second 18<br> months beginning in November of 1955.
