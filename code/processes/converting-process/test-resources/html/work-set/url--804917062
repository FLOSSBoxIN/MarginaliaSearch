Connect USB octopus, enables Logitech wireless mouse
Installed IATA89ENU Intel Matrix Storage Manager. Now reports RAID status on login.
Installed Windows Grep so I can look at the archdisk index files

Installed the SOAP Development Toolkit 3.0 (os-components)
Registered the DC-3 Registration Component (DC3Reg.dll) from the development area (release)
Installed Tortoise SVN 1.6.11.20210
Required reboot, system came up very slowly and eventually the screen went black. Hard reboot, RAID reports volume #0 errors, and Matrix Storage reports it failed. I doubt it. but now's the time for a system backup so...
Install Acronis TrueImage 2009. FAIL!!! No good on Win7/64
Purchase and Install TrueImage 2011.
---------------------
Back up C drive twice (Merops and Calaeno)
---------------------
Restart Acronis and let it update online - FAILED!
Login to Acronis site, register my 2011, then download the update from there.
Install PuTTY and the DC-3 keypairs. COnfigure for SSH to the A2 sites. Test with Tortoise, OK! 
Install Chrome standard (not the bleeding edge one!). 
*NOTE* Other nodes in the net back to not showing. WHY?
Installed Updated Acronis TrueImage 2011
Installed FocusMax 3.2.1 then 3.4.40
Installed MaxIm DL 5.12 and installed license.
Setup MaxIm cameras and filter wheel. Calibrate guider. Disable sounds.
Run FocusMax Simulator V-curves (2). FocusMax will now focus.
Install ACP 6.0 alpha, set up for Red Mountain. Runs OK.
---------------
BACK UP C Drive (Calaeno, replace one of above)
---------------
Install Targus BT dongle and WIDCOM 6 software. Looks OK.
NOTE: Device Manager shows WD SES device n/g (ugh)
      Device Manager shows Acronis Backup Explorer n/g but TrueImage Backup Explorer OK
Changed workgroup to DENNY and added DNS suffix, naming computer to bob.dc3.com, rebooted for that. Now other systems show in Network after about 30 sec.
Installed RocketDock and started on icons.
Ported over all of the FileZilla sites and settings.

Installed Stacks Docklet for RocketDock and configure astro and misc dev stacks.
Installed HyperSnap 6 and its license.
Installed Office 2007 Enterprise (partial, not all progs/features but including script debugger)
Installed Dreamweaver CS5 and activated. Set up window layout, saved. Found the old window layouts from CS4 work great. Bob's Best is exactly what I wanted.
Installed PrimalScript 2009 and its license. Imported settings from XP, OK. No help documents though.

Spent an hour looping through the  HP web trying to find drivers for the HP2100 LaserJet. FAIL! I got both universal PCL5 and PCL6 drivers but neither work when trying to add a networked 2100 served by my XP system SERVER. There are a bunch of .inf files in the folders but which one????? They have cryptic names. Their misnamed install.exe just opens the add new printer wizard and you end up looking in the same place. OH!!! Google search revealed you add a LOCAL printer, then use the share name for a new LOCAL port (if net share) and TCP port if ethernet printer (like our all in one 7600). Holy Shit, I did it. I let the printer wiz go to Windows Update for the big list and the 2100 was there. For the L7600 I chose a LOCAL printer again, TCP port, then that failed. I selected Custom and typed in the IP address for the TCP port. It failed to contact the printer but then showed the big list. Hand chose it and it installed and ran.

Set up Forum Backup project in MySQL Admin and scheduled it daily. Backups go to D:\web\commctr-backup (obviously). Tested and confirmed.

Installed GoldWave 5.58.
Create System Restore checkpoint.

Fun: Windows 7 doesn't have the "Stereo Mix" recording input option, apparently. It was working on this same system under Windows XP, so it's not a hardware limitation. I see it's listed in Device Manager as "High Definition Audio Device". I suspect I need real drivers. Went to Dell support, my system, found Analog Devices driver 6.10.2.7250 and installed it. It came up on reboot with those drivers. Wallah! I have it now. Open the Sound control panel, in the Recording tab, click Stereo Mix, then click the Set Default button. That will change it from Currently Unavailable to Default Device, and it will be ready to go!

Tested Windows Media with MP4(!) and GoldWave recording, working OK. Can record sound output now.

Installed Quicken 2009, let it update to R7
Move Quicken live files to DC3SERVER\c\QUICKEN on drive Q, allowing her to use the data without needing an account on this system.

Tried installing Vegas 9.0e, got error on VC++ 2005 and 2008 SP1 (x64) redistributables, failed to install them. I believe they are already there because I have both development systems installed. This is gonna take some snooping.

Installed Process Monitor 2.93, required for Win7/64. Will use to see what's going on with the Vegas 9 installer.

OK, I solved it. When the installer gets to the error message popup. let it sit there. Now go into C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Temp\SonyInstall_1. You will find all of the bits. Hand install vcredist_x86 (the VS2005 redist), and for 64-bit install vcredist2_x64 (the VS2008 SP1 (x64) redist). Then just run the Vegas90.msi installer that is in that same folder. That will start the main Vegas 9 installer. Vegas is installed and licensed now!
