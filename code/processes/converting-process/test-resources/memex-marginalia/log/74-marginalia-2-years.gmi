<br>
No time like the project's two year anniversary to drop this particular bomb...<br>
<br>
Marginalia's gotten an NLNet grant. This means I'll be able to work full time on this project at least a year. <br>
<br>
<a class="external" href="https://nlnet.nl/project/Marginalia/">https://nlnet.nl/project/Marginalia/</a><br>
<br>
This grant is essentially the best-case scenario for funding this project. It'll be able to remain independent, open-source, and non-profit. <br>
<br>
I won't start in earnest for a few months as I've got loose ends to tie up before I can devote that sort of time.  More details to come, but I'll say as much as the first step is a tidying up of the sources and a move off my self-hosted git instance to an external git host yet to be decided. <br>
<br>
<h2 id="1.1">Recap </h2>
<br>
It's been a heck of a year for Marginalia. Some highlights.<br>
<br>
The UX has been streamlined quite a bit. Forms for flagging problematic websites and submitting websites to be crawled.<br>
<br>
Overall the search result presentation is cleaner. The old search result page used a lot of weird emoji icons to convey information, I was never quite happy with that. <br>
<br>

<br>
The crawler was significantly redesigned.<br>
<br>
<a class="internal" href="/log/63-marginalia-crawler.gmi">/log/63-marginalia-crawler.gmi</a><br>
<br>
The index has been almost completely rewritten to be both faster and more space-efficient. I feel a bit bad I still haven't written about this. The re-design allowed the search engine to hit that sweet 100M document milestone a few months ago.<br>
<br>
I've had big success experimenting with website similarity metrics, and very recently I combined this method with PageRank. The result is good beyond expectations. The new algorithms are live on the search engine and working so well. <br>

<br>
There's been improvements in ad-detection, text-summarization, topic filtering, DOM-pruning, sharp sticks...<br>
<br>
With the grant there will definitely be a "Marginalia Search: 3 years"-post. I got most of the above done while juggling a lot of other life-stuff alongside Marginalia Search, as a solo dev. It'll be very interesting to see what sort of ground I'll be able to cover while working on this full time!<br>
