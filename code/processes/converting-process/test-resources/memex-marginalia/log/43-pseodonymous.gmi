A person might think I'm illusive, writing and working under a pseudonym. It's not that I'm hiding, if you send me an email, I'll respond to you with an email address containing a decent chunk of my real name. It's not out of shame I wear clothes.<br>
<br>
Besides bringing utility, marginalia.nu is an experiment, a bit of an art project, a place to challenge conventions and see what is and isn't necessary.<br>
<br>
There is risk for a conflict of interest if your website is both your resum√© and where you put your creative works and thoughts. Those are from different spheres and perhaps can't mix too much without detriment to the authenticity of the latter.<br>
<br>
Further, I think that there is far too much emphasis on identity. There is value in being a bit of a blank canvas. I like reading historical authors specifically because there is so much ambiguity in who they were, what they looked like, how they were like. This lets their words speak for themselves. <br>
<br>
In the end, I write and work under a pseudonym for the same reason none of the pages on this website have logos, why I don't gather statistics and analytics, why I've built all this software myself:<br>
<br>
To see what happens.<br>
<br>
This is not science, I don't run A/B tests on unsuspecting users like the sociopaths in big tech. My visitors aren't lab rats to be studied. I'm the rat, and this marginalia.nu is my maze; you're the one in with the clipboard and white coat.<br>
<br>
Maybe some of this is taking away too much, maybe it isn't. We'll never know if nobody tests the waters.<br>
