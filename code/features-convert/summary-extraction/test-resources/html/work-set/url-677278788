      <p><strong>UPDATE 12/31/2011:</strong>&nbsp;I have updated the Alix Centos 5 image to 5.7. &nbsp;During the process, I removed the /etc/ssh/ssh_host* keys so that each host will generate its own keys on boot up. &nbsp;Note that during the ‘yum upgrade’ process, I had boost the memory on the virtual image. Yum was unable to allocate enough ram with only 256 MB available. This means that it is unlikely that an update from 5.5 to 5.7 can be performed in a single step on a live board with only 256 MB of RAM.</p> 
      <p>As for the Centos 6 image, it is being troublesome because the up-line removed all of the non-pae kernel images for the 32-bit architecture. &nbsp;I’ve attempted to custom package a few kernels to complete the image but none of the work to my satisfaction.</p> 
      <p><strong>UPDATE 10/22/2010: </strong>Added a step in the ‘Using the Image’ section below. All active installations should ensure they replace their SSH System keys to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. I will post an updated image that has the keys removed when I get around to it. Until then, just perform the commands in item 7 of the Using the Image section.</p> 
      <p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>A new version of the image is available.&nbsp; It had ‘yum upgrade’ executed on June 12th, 2010, which upgraded it to Centos Version 5.5.&nbsp; The new image is located at <a title="http://software.freivald.com/centos/alix-centos-5.7-2gcf.gz" href="http://software.freivald.com/centos/alix-centos-5.7-2gcf.gz" target="_blank">http://software.freivald.com/centos/alix-centos-5.7-2gcf.gz</a>.&nbsp; There is also an MD5 sum file at <a title="http://software.freivald.com/centos/alix-centos-5.7-2gcf.md5" href="http://software.freivald.com/centos/alix-centos-5.7-2gcf.md5" target="_blank">http://software.freivald.com/centos/alix-centos-5.7-2gcf.md5</a>.</p> 
      <p>I could not find my 2 GB card. I used the original image, copied it to a 4 GB card, performed the update, and then copied only the first 2 GB back into the new image. Please provide feedback if the image does not work on a 2GB card.</p> 
      <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Hat-tip @Cris. In order to get the vga to work on the 3d3 board you must put the irqpoll as kernel boot parameter. &nbsp;See his comment for more information.</p> 
      <p><strong>INFO: </strong>For those who are unfamiliar with Centos, it is a distribution that is binary compatible with RedHat Enterprise Linux.</p> 
      <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> We’ve been added to the ALIX web page. Thank you for the testing and support from the PC-Engines crew.</p> 
      <p>I’ve been working with one of <a href="http://www.pcengines.ch/alix6e1.htm">PC Engine’s Alix 6e1 boards</a> a bit lately.&nbsp; It’s a 500 MHz i586 AMD Geode-based embedded board with 256 MB of RAM that sells for under $150. I was testing various distributions and found that Centos was pretty easy to adapt. It wasn’t listed as supported on the PC Engines Web Site, so I wanted to contribute an image back to the community.</p> 
      <p>The image I’ve created has the following changes from a base install:</p> 
      <p>1.&nbsp; It has no swap.</p> 
      <p>2.&nbsp; It has the noatime and nodiratime options for all mounted partitions, although it uses ext3 because of the wal-wart-no-backup-power-for-shutdown configuration.</p> 
      <p>3.&nbsp; Grub is configured for a 2-second timeout, and uses the serial port as the console – both for grub and the kernel. &nbsp;Hook up a terminal emulator set to 38000, 8N1 to view the boot sequence or access the console directly.</p> 
      <p>4.&nbsp; /etc/inittab was modified to use the serial console.&nbsp; xdm was also disabled.</p> 
      <p>5.&nbsp; All console settings are set for 38400 because that is what the initial boot-up bios uses on the ALIX 6e1 that I have.</p> 
      <p>6.&nbsp; /etc/securetty has been modified to allow login via /dev/ttyS0 (tty0 and vc/1 are also left open because I use VMWare to modify the image).</p> 
      <p>7.&nbsp; Fortunately, due to the stock Centos LVM configuration, no changes were necessary to fstab or the initrd image.</p> 
      <p>8.&nbsp; Only a base install was performed.&nbsp; Several of the ‘default’ packages have been omitted (things like bluetooth, extra shells, smart card reader daemon, procmail, cups, NetworkManager, etc. )&nbsp; Of course they are still available using YUM.</p> 
      <p>9.&nbsp; Lots of the startup stuff is turned off (kudzu, gpm, netfs, iptables and others).&nbsp; Use chkconfig to turn them back on if you want them.</p> 
      <p>10.&nbsp; The root password is – yep, you guess it: password</p> 
      <p>11. The eth0 (next to the USB ports) is configured for DHCP. eth1 (next to the serial port) is configured for 192.168.1.50. The hardware MAC lines have been commented out so that it will work with any box, but there is a slight chance that the order of the ports will get reversed. This has never happened to me, but YMMV. You can use either port to get the box up and running with ssh or putty if you don’t want to use or don’t have a serial interface.</p> 
      <p>12.&nbsp; The CF card I used was A 2GB SanDisk Ultra 15MB/s.&nbsp; Because it’s LVM based, you can use the LVM tools to shrink or grow the volumes.&nbsp; Check out the LVM Howto for all the recipies you need.</p> 
      <p>13. I updated the packages using ‘yum update’ on the day it was created, so hopefully you won’t have as much downloading to do. I did not enable centosplus, extras, or any other repositories, which makes the image binary compatible with RHEL 5.4.</p> 
      <p><strong>Using the Image</strong></p> 
      <p>1.&nbsp; Download the latest image from <a title="http://software.freivald.com/centos/" href="http://software.freivald.com/centos/" target="_blank">http://software.freivald.com/centos/</a>.</p> 
      <p>2.&nbsp; Unzip the image with bunzip2. &nbsp;Please verify the uncompressed image with md5sum. Several users who had issues simply had bad downloads or uncompressed the file improperly. &nbsp;An md5sum will catch these types of issues. &nbsp;The md5sum file is in the same directory as the image.</p> 
      <p>3. &nbsp;Copy it to your Compact Flash drive using ‘dd if=&lt;inputfile&gt; of=&lt;outputdevice&gt; bs=4096’. &nbsp;&lt;inputfile&gt; is the uncompressed image that you verified in step 2. &nbsp;&lt;outputdevice&gt; is your compact flash card. &nbsp;You can find the correct one for your system with ‘sudo parted -l’. &nbsp;You must use the disk device, not a partition i.e: /dev/sdc as opposed to /dev/sdc1. &nbsp;This will install the boot loader and all necessary partitions to have a running system. &nbsp;If your compact flash is larger than 2GB, see the comments section of this post for ways in which you can use the rest of the space.</p> 
      <p>4.&nbsp; Install the Compact Flash into the ALIX.</p> 
      <p>5.&nbsp; Attach your favorite terminal program to the ALIX platform.&nbsp; I use putty.exe under Windows or minicom under linux.</p> 
      <p>6.&nbsp; Apply power to the unit.&nbsp; It should boot without any fuss. If you don’t have a serial port, use eth0 (next to the USB) to have your DHCP router assign and address, or use eth1 (next to the serial port) for a static configuration. eth1 is configured for 192.168.1.50 and the connector auto-rolls the cable if it needs to, so configure your computer for something like 192.168.1.51 and ping until the system is online. Then use ssh, or putty.exe if you are using Windows, to access the unit.</p> 
      <p>7.&nbsp; I recommend some changes: Obviously, the root password.&nbsp; Also, add an MD5 password to the grub configuration, since without one anyone with a serial cable can pass parameters to the kernel. You will also probably want to add more software using yum. You might also want to create some scratch space under /tmp, or some of the /var/cache directories using tmpfs. I didn’t do any of the these because they are simple, and different users will have different requirements, especially with the advancement of CF cards (wear leveling, 1000000+writes/block, etc.). You will probably want to customize /etc/securetty for your installation.</p> 
      <p>8. On images earlier than 5.7, change the SSH server keys with:<br> $ sudo rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*<br> $ sudo /etc/init.d/sshd restart<br> (Hat tip to @pmoor for catching this one!)</p> 
      <p>With this setup, the initial boot up takes 1:32 and has 193MB of free memory. Enjoy.</p>

     <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-43"> <p>Well first, you don’t need the PAE kernel. It is for 32 bit environments with more than 4GB of RAM. The ALIX is 256MB max. You probably used a machine with a lot of RAM to do the install. You should use a virtual machine instead. If you don’t have VMWare then use qemu.</p> <p>I have a feeling the problem is in the mkinitrd environment. I’ve found that mkinitrd can be fussy about the environment it is in when it is created. Try booting the ALIX with my image and inserting your USB disk after it finishes booting. Make the changes to the grub.conf and fstab, and copy the root partition to your USB partition using tar*. After it’s done, run your mkinitrd directly on the ALIX device. Then try rebooting with the USB drive connected. Erase the root partition on the CF and reboot again. If we didn’t miss anything it will boot up properly on the USB.</p> <p>So the other question is: why do you want to have the root partition on the USB and not the CF?</p> <p>* the command for copying the root file system using tar is: mount /dev/[YourUSBPartition] /mnt; tar –one-file-system cpsvf – / | ( cd /mnt; tar xfp -)</p> <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I read another post { <a href="http://blog.psykotraz.com/2009/07/installing-centos-on-alix-2d2/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.psykotraz.com/2009/07/installing-centos-on-alix-2d2/</a> } where someone was having trouble trying to use the PAE kernel on the ALIX, so you might be okay just re-doing your install under qemu with 256MB of RAM.</p> <p><cite>Comment by admin — May 8, 2010 @ <a href="#comment-43">1:18 pm</a></cite> </p> </li>

     <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-45"> <p>Actually, both the USB and the Compact flash use flash memory, so six is one-half-dozen of the other. Not to worry, though, modern flash memory can have millions of writes per block, and the hardware has write leveling and error detection hardware that prevents any single block from being over-written disproportionately to the others and removes bad blocks from use transparently to the operating system and user.</p> <p>If you are still worried about it, keep the root /usr /boot and /etc on the compact flash (along with the virtual file systems that are in memory like /dev and /proc) and mount them read only. These file systems only change when you update the system with Yum and since CF should be faster than USB this should improve performance . Move high write systems like /var and /tmp to your removable media. Even better, move the highest traffic areas like /tmp to a tmpfs drive of 20-50 MB. tmpfs will only use the amount of memory that is actually in use by the file system, so you can make it as big as you have extra memory after you have all your services running.</p> <p>If you are truly paranoid about it, the Alix (at least the one I have) has a spot on the board for an IDE header. Solder in a new header and use a 2.5″ hard disk instead of the compact flash.</p> <p>Cheers.</p> <p><cite>Comment by admin — May 10, 2010 @ <a href="#comment-45">11:42 am</a></cite> </p> </li>

If you are going to work on software for your ALIX, I would recommend compiling it on a full-speed machine, or even a virtual machine. If you create an RPM spec script and package it as an rpm file, then you will only need to install the rpm with the binaries on the ALIX and you won’t have all the extra stuff lying around. You also won’t have libraries on the machine that aren’t accounted for in your rpm database. Creating an rpm is not hard, and will save you mountains of time and headache in the long run. Check out <a href="http://software.freivald.com/centos" rel="nofollow">my software repository</a> for some examples of RPMs that I distribute. I try very hard to make them tidy and not cludgy.

For that you would create a second physical volume, add it to the volume group or create a new volume group, create a new logical volume, create the file system and then mount it somewhere (/usr /var or /home would be good, depending on your requirements). If you are mounting it under /usr of /var you will want to migrate the files by mounting the new file system under /mnt and using tar to move them. All of this could be done on a live machine, but the original /usr and /var space wouldn’t be recovered until you mounted it under with a separate machine and removed the files. This is what I would do to get one or two systems online.</p> <p>Another way would be to add the new physical volume, add it to the volume group and then grow the logical volume to the new size. Then you would have to grow the ext3 file system by first removing the journal (using tune2fs, which would make it an ext2 file system) and then resizing it. Both of those operations have to be done unmounted, so the card must be loaded into another linux box during the whole process. This is what I would do if I were doing a dozen or so.</p> <p>The last way would be to mount the image on a separate machine, create the proper LVM structure on the new flash, copy the files from the image to the new box (using a piped tar is the easiest way to do this), mount this new image with QEMU or VMwareWorkstation, boot the virtual image with a CD, chroot to the new card, install the boot-loader and reset the selinux permissions. This way is the only way you wind up with a single LVM physical partition, but it’s a lot more work and I don’t think it buys you much. This is what I would do to provide a clean image to the community, or as a baseline project to build multiple projects on.</p> <p>Cheers.</p> <p>–JATF</p> <p><cite>Comment by <a href="http://joseph.freivald.com/" rel="external nofollow" class="url">jfreivald</a> — August 26, 2010 @ <a href="#comment-62">11:19 am</a></cite> </p> </li>

     <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="comment-110"> <p>Joe, Excellent work on this project! Inspired by your efforts, I have used Virtualbox with USB redirection to install CentOS directly to a 2.5″ IDE hard drive (using a USB to IDE dongle). It is my hope to explore further into the tweaks you did to minimize wasteful writes to the CF, and make them part of a CentOS kickstart config post install script. I have been using the UDA Appliance (www.ultimatedployment.org) to automate repetitive installs via PXE boot in our environment – which happens to be a data center environment where remote installation is the norm.</p> <p>The ALIX board’s 256MB of RAM is plenty to run CentOS, however, not apparently enough to install successfully. Anaconda chokes and runs out of memory when you install via NFS or HTTP. Since ALIX boards do not support booting from USB, the PXE boot install option is all that is left. I have thought of writing a shell script that could do the partitioning of the CF card and/or hard drive media (while physically on the ALIX), and then mounting the ISO off the local partition. I would still copy the installation media over NFS or HTTP, but it would make Anaconda happy. This would then leave enough memory for Anaconda to complete the job, or even allow swap space to be enabled ahead of the dependency checking process which is where all the memory gets eaten up.</p> <p>The other option I am considering is to use a PXE boot environment to fetch a copy of the raw disk image and then use dd to write the image to the CF and/or hard drive. If I find either option works, I still would need to automate the installation of CentOS to accommodate it to the ALIX hardware.</p> <p>Do you use a shell script to modify the install in VMWare prior to imaging it? I would imagine that such a shell script could be adapted to work as part of a kickstart config. The UDA appliance provides the plumbing to make the kickstart configuration very easy and relatively painless. If you have any scripts that you could share, I would like to help adapt them for a similar installation/build using the UDA appliance.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> <p>Matt</p> <p><cite>Comment by mattorola7 — December 29, 2010 @ <a href="#comment-110">2:00 pm</a></cite> </p> </li>

Your post got lost in the shuffle and I didn’t see it until today.</p> <p>I don’t do anything fancy to perform the VMWare install. One of the nice things about VMWare is that I can put the memory at 2GB for the install and then throttle it down when I’m testing the running image. Anaconda is a huge hog, and I hate tweaking with it. I played around with it years ago trying to get a custom build with extra packages under Fedora and found it was much less painful to add a repository after the install with a yum install group and perform my installs that way. It also turns out to be more portable, since I can then create repositories for EL, Centos and others without the need to fuss with an installer or kickstart scripts. The only reason I can see monkeying with a kickstart disk is on network-isolated boxes in secure areas that do not allow USB storage.</p> <p>As for the ALIX adjustments, they are done by-hand. I plan to do another release when Centos 6 comes out. The build crew are reporting that it’s still a few weeks out.</p> <p>–JATF</p> <p><cite>Comment by <a href="http://joseph.freivald.com/" rel="external nofollow" class="url">jfreivald</a> — January 10, 2011 @ <a href="#comment-114">5:52 pm</a></cite> </p> </li>

Edit /etc/sysconfig/vncserver and put in the user you want to use. Start the server once manually for the user, and then edit the .startup file in the user’s .vncserver directory to start the app you want instead of xterm. Xdm will be the default window manager, which is NOT user friendly to non-unix heads, but fine if you set it up like a kiosk. I wouldn’t attempt KDE or GNOME as their memory requirements are too high.

     <li class="comment byuser comment-author-jfreivald bypostauthor odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-123"> <p>@coq-rogue</p> <p>I sincerely doubt that you have a bad board. If you are going to do more than one box it is probably a good idea to invest in a USB to Serial cable and a null-modem adapter so yo u can use the console port. Not only does it give you the BIOS and GRUB bootloader access, but it also prints out all of the boot-up sequence message, kernel debug messages and gives you the ability to change the network configuration without losing control of your session. It saves the cost in frustration, confusion and anguish – which is an easy trade. 🙂</p> <p>You are welcome to try the 5.4 board – a ‘yum upgrade’ will bring it up to date in short order, but I’ve used the 5.5 image several times (6 installs + 10 or 15 writes to flush a CF back to starting configuration after I’m done testing) on both 2 and 4 gb flash drives, plus it gets downloaded between 2 and 20 times each day and only a few people have had issues, so I’m leaning toward the image being just fine and the individual set-ups that are being used are the problem. In your case I’m highly suspicious of the Windows environment. In my experience unix tools almost never work just as they should under M$ systems.

     <li class="comment byuser comment-author-jfreivald bypostauthor even thread-even depth-1" id="comment-134"> <p>@T-One</p> <p>I had considered each of those items when creating the image. Our requirements are somewhat different. If you are maintaining an image for your work you have tight control over who does what to the unit. Releasing the image to the public, I must consider that novice builders will use the image to make a variety of appliances and I wanted to make it as bulletproof as possible. Plus, let’s be honest: I’m lazy, and the closer I can keep it to a stock Centos install, the less likely I’ll be to have people asking questions because something isn’t where they expect it to be. 😉</p> <p>I selected ext3 because the Alix has no backup power facilities, and if someone uses it for a SOHO router or firewall it is very likely that a user will unplug the unit at some point to reset the network, or a power outage will cause the unit to be reset mid-process. Ext3 should automatically recover from this, but ext2, without the journal, has a high probability of causing the file system to stall when the unit is booted next, requiring a console hook-up to complete the fsck cycle. For most appliances, this would be considered unacceptable. Advanced users will know that they can turn the journal off with tune2fs, but the novice builder will be better off with this safeguard. Modern flash cartridges use write leveling and bad-block exclusion and each block is good for tens of millions of writes, so even with the journal they should last years and years as an appliance. Also, the use of tmpfs should limit the flash-based writes to the /tmp directory. The Alix’s processor and memory specifications restrict it from being an effective server for write-intensive services like a major database or web server anyway, so I think there is very little risk there. If someone is looking to use the Alix in a write-intensive environment (say, as an IDS logger) they are most likely an advanced user and should solder an IDE header in place and put in a 1.8″ or 2.5″ hard disk instead of flash. They’ll have much more space and much better long-term performance since the flash write performance will degrade over time.</p> <p>As for the space savings, I considered that the price of flash having dropped like a stone the last few years and the small level of space savings compared to the 2GB image size did not warrant the inconvenience of having no documentation or basic services at the builder’s disposal. Again, the advanced user can remove any package they wish with a variety of tools, but the novice may not know exactly how to get that basic functionality back, or at the very least might have to waste many hours trying to figure it out. I run my servers with 4GB cards and 8 – 64GB cards are available for someone who might need vast amounts of space in a small package, or who want to extend the run-time of the unit.</p> <p>I thought about having more descriptive LVM names, but most tutorials online use the standard names so I just stuck with them. Again: Keep it simple so I can be lazy.</p> <p>Thanks for the input. I’m not attempting to be argumentative and hopefully I’m not letting my ego get the best of me. I just wanted to let you know that I did think about each of the points you brought up. I might have made bad decisions for some people, but I hope that they are good decisions for most people. 🙂</p> <p>It’s nice to know I have a bedfellow out there working the Alix/Centos images. Do you have many of the platforms? I have only the 6e2. I’ve been swamped with our youngest son finishing High School and my wife starting a new job so I haven’t done an upgrade to 5.6 yet. I’ll be on travel for two weeks and I plan to bring one with me to work on in the hotel.

Doing a post mortem off a failure of a production device is critical, and modern flash drives are very robust. Each cell can be written to millions of times, and the flash disk hardware ensures that the lifespan of the device is maximized by using write leveling (prevents you from writing to the same spot over and over, even if you try), and error correction and lockout (verifys each block after write and locks out blocks as they fail). What I would do is this: on your test device, verify the average daily log file size in blocks. Calculate how many blocks per year are expected to be written. Divide by 1,000,000 writes. That’s how many blocks you would ‘consume’ (as in wear out completely) in one year. Multiply by the lifespan of the device (say 10 years), and then double that amount.</p> <p>You will notice that unless your logs are VERY large, the results are small enough as to be meaningless because there wouldn’t be enough of them to store the data in the first place. That’s because flash drives are very, very robust and you shouldn’t worry about it unless you are really pushing the limits.</p> <p>The benefits of having system logs far outweigh the maintenance headache they may cause.</p> <p>Cheers.</p> <p>–JATF</p> <p><cite>Comment by <a href="http://joseph.freivald.com/" rel="external nofollow" class="url">jfreivald</a> — August 26, 2011 @ <a href="#comment-139">7:05 pm</a></cite> </p> </li>

     <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-1329"> <p>Thanks for the effort in making the image. I have a couple if minor problems with the image that you may be able to help with.</p> <p>The first is permissions on /dev/ttyS0. They come up as 0600. I need them to be 0666 I tried changing that in rc.local but it doesn’t seem to have any effect. I also fiddled with udev rules for “console” but no result either.</p> <p>I can change the permissions if I log in as root after booting has completed. What I want to do is have them set to 0666 as part of the boot process. Any suggestions?</p> <p>The second problem is the ntp client. My boards don’t have batteries for the RTC and ntp refuses to adjust the time as the power-on difference is too great. Any suggestion on how to make the time always adjust?</p> <p>Thanks</p> <p><cite>Comment by JeremyArdley — October 12, 2014 @ <a href="#comment-1329">7:34 pm</a></cite> </p> </li>
