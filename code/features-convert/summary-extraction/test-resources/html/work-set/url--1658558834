   </div> <big style="font-family: Verdana;"><br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br> <span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">Introduction by John Lauritsen</span></span><br style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);"> <span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Percy Bysshe Shelley, one of our greatest poets, was a brilliant translator as well &#x2014; only equalled among poets, if at all, by Pope and Dryden. He translated three of the Plato dialogues: </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">The Banquet</span><span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);"> </span><a style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);" href="#star">*</a> (<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">Symposium</span><span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">) in 1818 and </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">Ion</span><span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);"> in 1821. His translation of <i><b>Phaedo</b></i> is lost.</span><br style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);"> <span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shelley especially relished the central conceit of </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">Ion</span><span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">: Poets and their interpreters are all mad &#x2014; or, as it were, divinely inspired.</span><br style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);"> <br style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);"> </big> 
   <div style="margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">
    <big style="font-family: Verdana;">The God seems purposely to have deprived all poets, prophets, and soothsayers of every particle of reason and understanding, the better to adapt them to their employment as his ministers and interpreters; and that we, their auditors, may acknowledge that those who write so beautifully are possessed and address us inspired by the God. (From the Shelley translation of Ion)</big>
    <br> 
   </div> <big style="font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(102, 51, 0);"><br> He expanded upon and reinterpreted this idea for his famous essay, &#x201c;A Defence of Poetry&#x201d;, in which he wrote:<br> <br> </big> 
   <div style="margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">
    <big style="font-family: Verdana;">Poets are the hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration; the mirrors of the gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the present; the words which express what they understand not; the trumpets which sing to battle and feel not what they inspire; the influence which is moved not, but moves. Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world. (Shelley, &#x201c;A Defence of Poetry&#x201d;)</big>
    <br> 
   </div> <big style="font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(102, 51, 0);"><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shelley did not strive for a slavishly literal, word-for-word translation. Though he was loyal to the sense and spirit of Plato's Greek, he did not hesitate to condense a long passage into its essence, or on the other hand, to add his own interpolations. His goal was to understand Plato's meaning fully, and then to re-create that meaning in English.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shelley's translation of <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ion</span> is not a masterpiece in its own right, as are his translations of Plato's <i><b>Banquet</b></i> or of the Homeric hymn, &#x201c;To Mercury&#x201d;. Nevertheless, his <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ion</span> translation conveys wit and irony; the dialogue is natural as well as elevated; and the ideas come across clearly. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most famous passage in <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ion</span> is a long speech by Socrates, where divine inspiration is likened to the effect of a magnet. Here Shelley comes into his own, and, though it may be nearly two centuries old, his rendition excels all others for beauty of language. Here is an excerpt from the magnet speech:<br> <br> </big> 
   <div style="margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">
    <big style="font-family: Verdana;">[The souls of poets], flying like bees from flower to flower and wandering over the gardens and the meadows and the honey-flowing fountains of the Muses, return to us laden with the sweetness of melody; and arrayed as they are in the plumes of rapid imagination they speak truth. For a poet is indeed a thing ethereally light, winged, and sacred, nor can he compose anything worth calling poetry until he becomes inspired and as it were mad; or whilst any reason remains in him. For whilst a man retains any portion of the thing called reason he is utterly incompetent to produce poetry or to vaticinate. (From the Shelley translation of <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ion</span>)</big>
    <br> 
   </div> <big style="font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(102, 51, 0);"><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ion</span> is a dialogue which has polarized critics: some are hostile to it, while others, who do like it, believe it has been misinterpreted. Without wishing to get embroiled in the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ion</span> controversies, I'll simply lay out my thoughts on the dialogue.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ion may seem obtuse and boastful, and under the questioning of Socrates he becomes seriously confused, but he is a good sport. There is a degree of irony when Socrates flatters Ion, as he does in the beginning of the dialogue &#x2014; but perhaps there is also a smidgeon of irony in Ion's flattery of Socrates. <br> <br> </big> 
   <div style="margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">
    <big style="font-family: Verdana;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Socrates. The same mode of consideration must be admitted with respect to all arts which are severally one and entire. Do you desire to hear what I understand by this, O Ion?</big>
    <br> 
   </div> 
   <div style="margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">
    <big style="font-family: Verdana;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ion. Yes, by Jupiter, Socrates, I am delighted with listening to you wise men. (<span style="font-style: italic;">Ibid.</span>)</big>
    <br> 
   </div> <big style="font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(102, 51, 0);"><br> On the whole the exchanges are good-natured, and Socrates treats Ion gently at the end.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A central idea of <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ion</span> is the distinction between real and fake (pretended, simulated) knowledge or skill. One should not confuse the military abilities of a real general with those of an actor portraying a general, and so on. (On this note we might recall that in the 1990s the actors from Mash were on the collegiate circuit as lecturers on foreign policy, based presumably on the expertise they acquired from playing their roles in the television series.)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Socrates in <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ion</span> also criticizes the misuse of Homer as holy text, as the authority on everything from charioteering to warfare. The salient present-day analogy here is the fundamentalist use of the &#x201c;Holy Bible&#x201d; as the authority on everything, from morality to geology. Again, the concern is for truth. Is the Grand Canyon better explained by the book of <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Genesis</span> or by modern geology?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes Socrates and Ion speak at cross-purposes, but Ion is not a complete dunce. At least once he turns the tables on Socrates, asking him to base his opinions on evidence, not pre-conceived ideas:<br> <br> </big> 
   <div style="margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">
    <big style="font-family: Verdana;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ion. You speak well, O Socrates. Yet I should be surprised if you had eloquence enough to persuade me that when I praise Homer I am mad and possessed. I think you would change your opinion if you once heard me declaim. (From the Shelley translation of <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ion</span>)</big>
    <br> 
   </div> <big style="font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(102, 51, 0);"><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ion comes to the defence of his own profession, that of actor or rhapsodist: <br> <br> </big> 
   <div style="margin-left: 40px; color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">
    <big style="font-family: Verdana;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I imagine that the rhapsodist has a perfect acquaintance with what is becoming for a man to speak, what for a woman; what for a slave, what for a free man; what for the ruler, what for the governed. (Ibid.)</big>
    <br> 
   </div> <big style="font-family: Verdana;"><br style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);"> <span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">This is a fair description of the actor's art. He doesn't need to know all the skills or details of the people he portrays, but rather what they are like, how they speak, and so on. It's a pity Socrates couldn't have interrogated Laurence Olivier, Alec Guinness &#x2014; or, for that matter, Bette Davis. They might have given him a run for the money. On the other hand, Olivier and Guinness might have taken the opportunity to study Socrates, the better to portray him on the stage. I like to imagine Ion in his old age giving dramatic readings of the Plato dialogues, enthusiastically declaiming the part of Socrates.</span><br style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);"> <span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At any rate, long introductions are tiresome, and it's time to let Socrates, Ion, and Shelley speak for themselves.</span><br style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);"> <span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">&nbsp;</span><a style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);" name="star"></a><br style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);"> <span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">* For a description of the Pagan Press edition of Shelley's translation of the </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">Banquet</span><span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);"> &#x2014; the only one which includes his introductory essay, &#x201c;A Discourse on the Manners of the Antient Greeks&#x201d; &#x2014; </span><a style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);" href="http://paganpressbooks.com/BOOKLIST.HTM">click here</a><span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">.</span><br style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);"> <br> <br> <br> <br> </big>

    <br> 
   </div> <big style="font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(0, 0, 102);"><br> SOCRATES and ION<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> Hail to thee, O Ion! from whence returnest thou amongst us now? &#x2014; from thine own native Ephesus?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> No, Socrates; I come from Epidaurus and the feasts in honour of Aesculapius.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> Had the Epidaurians instituted a contest of rhapsody in honour of the God?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> And not in rhapsodies alone; there were contests in every species of music.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> And in which did you contend? And what was the success of your efforts?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> I bore away the first prize at the games, O Socrates.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> Well done! You have only to consider how you shall win the Panathenaea.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> That may also happen, God willing.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> Your profession, O Ion, has often appeared to me an enviable one. For, together with the nicest care of your person and the most studied elegance of dress, it imposes upon you the necessity of a familiar acquaintance with many and excellent poets, and especially with Homer, the most admirable of them all. Nor is it merely because you can repeat the verses of this great poet that I envy you, but because you fathom his inmost thoughts. For he is no rhapsodist who does not understand the whole scope and intention of the poet and is not capable of interpreting it to his audience. This he cannot do without a full comprehension of the meaning of the author he undertakes to illustrate; and worthy indeed of envy are those who can fulfil these conditions.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> Thou speakest truth, O Socrates. And indeed I have expended my study particularly on this part of my profession. I flatter myself that no man living excels me in the interpretation of Homer; neither Metrodorus of Lampsacus, nor Stesimbrotus the Thasian, nor Glauco, nor any other rhapsodist of the present times can express so many various and beautiful thoughts upon Homer as I can.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> I am persuaded of your eminent skill, O Ion. You will not, I hope, refuse me a specimen of it?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> And indeed it would be worth your while to hear me declaim upon Homer. I deserve a golden crown from his admirers.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> And I will find leisure some day or other to request you to favour me so far. At present I will only trouble you with one question. Do you excel in explaining Homer alone or are you conscious of a similar power with regard to Hesiod and Archilochus?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> I possess this high degree of skill with regard to Homer alone and I consider that sufficient.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> Are there any subjects upon which Homer and Hesiod say the same things?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> Many, as it seems to me.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> Do you demonstrate these things better in Homer or Hesiod?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> In the same manner, doubtless; inasmuch as they say the same words with regard to the same things.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> But with regard to those things in which they differ &#x2014; Homer and Hesiod both treat of divination, do they not?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> Certainly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> Do you think that you or a diviner would make the best exposition respecting all that these poets say of divination, both as they agree and as they differ?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> A diviner probably.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> Suppose you were a diviner, do you not think that you could explain the discrepancies of those poets on the subject of your profession, if you understand their agreement?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> Clearly so.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> How does it happen then that you are possessed of skill to illustrate Homer and not Hesiod or any other poets in an equal degree? Is the subject-matter of the poetry of Homer different from all other poets? Does he not principally treat of war and social intercourse; and of the distinct functions and characters of the brave man and the coward, the professional and private person; the mutual relations which subsist between the Gods and men, together with the modes of their intercourse, the phaenomena of Heaven, the secrets of Hades, and the origin of Gods and heroes? Are not these the materials from which Homer wrought his poem?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> Assuredly, O Socrates.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> And the other poets, do they not treat of the same matter? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> Certainly, but not like Homer.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> How? Worse? <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> Oh, far worse. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> Then Homer treats of them better than they?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> Oh Jupiter! &#x2014; how much better!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates</span>. Amongst a number of persons employed in solving a problem of arithmetic might not a person know, my dear Ion, which had given the right answer?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> Certainly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> The same person who had been aware of the false one or some other?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> The same clearly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> That is, some one who understood arithmetic? <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> Certainly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> Among a number of persons giving their opinions on the wholesomeness of different foods, would one person be capable to pronounce upon the rectitude of the opinions of those who judged rightly and another on the erroneousness of those which were incorrect, or would the same person be competent to decide respecting them both? <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> The same evidently.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> What would you call that person? <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> A physician.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> We may assert then universally that the same person who is competent to determine the truth is competent also to determine the falsehood of whatever assertion is advanced an the same subject; and it is manifest that he who cannot judge respecting the falsehood or unfitness of what is said upon a given subject is equally incompetent to determine upon its truth or beauty.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> Assuredly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> The same person would then be competent or incompetent for both?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> Yes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> Do you not say that Homer and the other poets, and among them Hesiod and Archilochus, speak of the same things but unequally, one better and the other worse?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> And I speak truth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> But if you can judge of what is well said by the one you must also be able to judge of what is ill said by the other. <a href="#note1">[1]</a><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> It should seem so.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> Then, my dear friend, we should not err if we asserted that Ion possessed a like power of illustration respecting Homer and all other poets; especially since he confesses that the same person must be esteemed a competent judge of all those who speak on the same subjects; inasmuch as those subjects are understood by him when spoken of by one, and the subject-matter of almost all the poets is the same.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> What can be the reason then, O Socrates, that when any other poet is the subject of conversation I cannot compel my attention, and I feel utterly unable to declaim anything worth talking of, and positively go to sleep; but when any one makes mention of Homer my mind applies itself without effort to the subject; I awaken as if it were from a trance and a profusion of eloquent expressions suggest themselves involuntarily?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> It is not difficult to conjecture the cause of this, my dear friend. You are evidently unable to declaim on Homer according to art and knowledge; for did your art endow you with this faculty, you would be equally capable of exerting it with regard to any other of the poets. Is not poetry, as an art or a faculty, a thing entire and one?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> Assuredly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> The same mode of consideration must be admitted with respect to all arts which are severally one and entire. Do you desire to hear what I understand by this, O Ion?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> Yes, by Jupiter, Socrates, I am delighted with listening to you wise men.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> It is you who are wise, my dear Ion; you rhapsodists, actors, and the authors of the poems you recite. I, like an unprofessional and private man, can only speak the truth. Observe how common, vulgar, and level to the comprehension of any one is the question which I now ask relative to the same consideration belonging to one entire art. Is not painting an art whole and entire?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> Yes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> Are there not and have there not been many painters both good and bad?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> Certainly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> Did you ever know a person competent to judge of the paintings of Polygnotus, the son of Aglaophon, and incompetent to judge of any other painter; who, on the compositions of the works of other painters being exhibited to him, was wholly at a loss, and very much inclined to go to sleep, and lost all faculty of reasoning on the subject; but when his opinion was required of Polygnatus or any one single painter you please, awoke, paid attention to the subject, and discoursed on it with great eloquence and sagacity?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> Never, by Jupiter!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> Did you ever know any one very skilful in determining the merits of Daedalus, the son of Metion, Epius, the son of Panopus, Theodorus the Samian, or any other great sculptor, who was immediately at a loss and felt sleepy the moment any other sculptor was mentioned? <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> I never met with such a person certainly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> Nor do I think that you ever met with a man professing himself a judge of poetry and rhapsody, and competent to criticise either Olympus, Thamyris, Orpheus, or Phemius of Ithaca, the rhapsodist, who, the moment he came to Ion the Ephesian, felt himself quite at a loss, utterly incompetent to judge whether he rhapsodised well or ill.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> I cannot refute you, Socrates, but of this I am conscious to myself: that I excel all men in the copiousness and beauty of my illustrations of Homer, as all who have heard me will confess, and with respect to other poets I am deserted of this power. It is for you to consider what may be the cause of this distinction.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socrates.</span> I will tell you, O Ion, what appears to me to be the cause of this inequality of power. It is that you are not master of any art for the illustration of Homer but it is a divine influence which moves you, like that which resides in the stone called Magnet by Euripides, and Heraclea by the people. For not only does this stone possess the power of attracting iron rings but it can communicate to them the power of attracting other rings; so that you may see sometimes a long chain of rings and other iron substances attached and suspended one to the other by this influence. And as the power of the stone circulates through all the links of this series and attaches each to each, so the Muse communicating through those whom she has first inspired to all others capable of sharing in the inspiration the influence of that first enthusiasm, creates a chain and a succession. For the authors of those great poems which we admire do not attain to excellence through the rules of any art but they utter their beautiful melodies of verse in a state of inspiration and, as it were, possessed by a spirit not their own. Thus the composers of lyrical poetry create those admired songs of theirs in a state of divine insanity, like the Corybantes, who lose all control over their reason in the enthusiasm of the sacred dance; and, during this supernatural possession, are excited to the rhythm and harmony which they communicate to men; like the Bacchantes who, when possessed by the God, draw honey and milk from the rivers in which, when they come to their senses, they find nothing but simple water. For the souls of the poets, as poets tell us, have this peculiar ministration in the world. They tell us that these souls, flying like bees from flower to flower and wandering over the gardens and the meadows and the honey-flowing fountains of the Muses, return to us laden with the sweetness of melody; and arrayed as they are in the plumes of rapid imagination they speak truth. For a poet is indeed a thing ethereally light, winged, and sacred, nor can he compose anything worth calling poetry until he becomes inspired and as it were mad; or whilst any reason remains in him. For whilst a man retains any portion of the thing called reason he is utterly incompetent to produce poetry or to vaticinate.<a href="#note2"> [2]</a> Thus those who declaim various and beautiful poetry upon any subject, as for instance upon Homer, are not enabled to do so by art or study; but every rhapsodist or poet, whether dithyrambic <a href="#note3">[3]</a>, encomiastic <a href="#note4">[4]</a>, choral, epic, or iambic <a href="#note5">[5]</a>, is excellent in proportion to the extent of his participation in the divine influence and the degree in which the Muse itself has descended on him. In other respects poets may be sufficiently ignorant and incapable. For they do not compose according to any art which they have acquired but from the impulse of the divinity within them; for did they know any rules of criticism according to which they could compose beautiful verses upon one subject they would be able to exert the same faculty with respect to all or any other. The God seems purposely to have deprived all poets, prophets, and soothsayers of every particle of reason and understanding, the better to adapt them to their employment as his ministers and interpreters; and that we, their auditors, may acknowledge that those who write so beautifully are possessed and address us inspired by the God. A presumption in favour of this opinion may be drawn from the circumstance of Tynnichus the Chalcidian having composed no other poem worth mentioning except the famous poem which is in everybody's mouth, perhaps the most beautiful of all lyrical compositions and which he himself calls a gift of the Muses. I think you will agree with me that examples of this sort are exhibited by the God himself to prove that those beautiful poems are not human nor from man but divine and from the Gods; and that poets are only the inspired interpreters of the Gods, each excellent in proportion to the degree of this inspiration. This example of the most beautiful of lyrics having been produced by a poet in other respects the worst seems to have been afforded as a divine evidence of the truth of this opinion. &#x2014; Do you not think with me, Ion?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ion.</span> By Jupiter, I do.

You, the actor or rhapsodist, represent the intermediate one and the poet that attached to the magnet itself.

And as from that stone so a long chain of poets, theatrical performers, and subordinate teachers and professors of the musical art, laterally connected with the main series, are suspended from the Muse itself as from the origin of the influence. We call this inspiration and our expression indeed comes near to the truth; for the person who is an agent in this universal and reciprocal attraction is indeed possessed, and some are attracted and suspended by one of the poets who are the first rings in this great chain and some by another. Some are possessed by Orpheus, some by Musaeus, and many, among whom you may be numbered, my dear friend, by Homer. And so complete is his possession of you that you daze and are at a loss when any one proposes the verses of any other poet as the subject of recitation; but no sooner is a single passage of this poet recited than you awaken and your soul dances within you and dictates words at will. For it is not through art or knowledge that you illustrate Homer but from a divine influence and election, like the Corybantes who hear no sound except that penetrating melody which proceeds from the Deity by whom they are possessed, and although mad in other respects, are capable of accommodating their words and their dress to the rhythm of that music. Hence, O Ion, you have a power of speech respecting Homer alone, and this is the cause which you sought why that power is united to Homer; it is by a divine election and not through art that you have attained so singular an excellence in panegyrizing and illustrating this Poet.</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102);"> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102);"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 102);">Ion.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102);"> You speak well, O Socrates.
