  <p> <font size="+1"> Many Brandeis graduates who have pursued careers in law had some exposure to philosophy while they were undergraduates at Brandeis. This is not surprising. Every philosophy course taught at Brandeis helps students to develop analytical skills that are invaluable in the practice of law and this is true of every course currently taught by the Department, whether the course is one directly related to law, such as Philosophy of Law, or whether its focus is elsewhere, say on Amercian Pragmatism or on the Philosophy of Religion. <br></font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"> Below you will find a list of courses taught in the Philosophy Department that may be of special interest to students who are contemplating a career in law, but it should be borne in mind that any course in philosophy can introduce you to the basic skills essential to the study and practice of law, to help you to improve upon your ability to make and evaluate arguments, to anticipate and respond to objections, and to uncover principles that may help to explain conflicting judgments of similar cases. <br></font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"> The Department welcomes students with an interest in law, and is eager to help each student find the right mix of courses that will suit his or her specific needs. Majors in other fields, in Politics, Economics, or History, for example, who wish to pursue legal careers need not become Philosophy Majors to benefit from the courses the Department has to offer. The pre-law student who takes one or two courses in Philosophy in addition to fulfilling his or her course requirements in another Field will be far better prepared to enter law school than a pre-law candidate who has had no exposure to philosophy at all. <br> </font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"> A recent comprehensive study of college students' scores on major tests used for admission to graduate and professional schools shows that students majoring in Philosophy received scores substantially higher than the average on each of the tests studied. <br></font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"> The performance of Philosophy Majors on all three tests was remarkable: Philosophy Majors received higher scores on the LSAT, for instance, than students in all other humanities areas, and higher scores than all social and natural science majors except economics and mathematics, and higher scores than all applied majors.<br></font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"> Moreover, the differences in most cases were substantial: <br></font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"> Philosophy Majors scored 10% better than political science majors on the LSAT. Philosophy Majors outperformed business majors by a margin of 15% on the GMAT and outperformed every other undergraduate major except mathematics. And Philosophy Majors' scores on the verbal portion of the GRE were higher than in any other major even English; and although several science majors showed higher averages in the quantitative portion of the test, Philosophy Majors scored substantially higher than all other humanities majors and were alone among humanities majors in scoring above the overall average.<br></font></p>
  <p><font size="+1"> The study compared the scores of 550,000 college students who took the LSAT, GMAT, and the verbal and quantitative portions of the GRE with data collected over the previous eighteen years and was conducted by the National Institute of Education and reported in THE CHRONICLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION.<br></font></p>
