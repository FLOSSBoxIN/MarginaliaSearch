<i>This recipe will produce a flavour and colour akin to that of English toffee, with cholcolate and caramel flavours also being present on the follow through.  Try straining the intial brew before adding yeast for extra clarity.  I'm not sure of the exact EBU but this beer is reminiscent of the traditional Yorkshire bitter (although less red in appearance).  A full bodied brew with a crisp, dry finish well suited to lounging around on hot summer days!
