        It appears no nodes have been configured!  This is necessary before any index or executor services
        can be started.  At least a single node needs to be configured to serve search queries.

    <div class="my-3 p-3 border bg-light">
        Index nodes are processing units.  The search engine requires at least one, but more can be added
        to spread the system load across multiple physical disks or even multiple servers.
