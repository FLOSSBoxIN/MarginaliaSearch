This micro library handles the GeoIP lookups, mappings from IP addresses
to country codes.  

It uses the free ip2location lite database, which is
available from [https://lite.ip2location.com/database/ip-country](https://lite.ip2location.com/database/ip-country)
under a CC-BY-SA 4.0 license.

It also handles mapping from IP to ASN (Autonomous System Number) using
data from apnic.net.
