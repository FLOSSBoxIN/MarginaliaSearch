* [guarded-regex](guarded-regex/) makes predicated regular expressions clearer
* [big-string](big-string/) offers seamless string compression
* [random-write-funnel](random-write-funnel/) is a tool for reducing write amplification when constructing 
large files out of order.
* [next-prime](next-prime/) naive brute force prime sieve.
