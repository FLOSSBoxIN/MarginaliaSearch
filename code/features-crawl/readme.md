# Crawl Features

These are bits of search-engine related code that are relatively isolated pieces of business logic,
that benefit from the clarity of being kept separate from the rest of the crawling code.

* [content-type](content-type/) - Content Type identification
* [crawl-blocklist](crawl-blocklist/) - IP and URL blocklists
* [link-parser](link-parser/) - Code for parsing and normalizing links
