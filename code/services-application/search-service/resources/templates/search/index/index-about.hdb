            <p>This is an independent DIY search engine that focuses on non-commercial content, and attempts to
                show you sites you perhaps weren't aware of in favor of the sort of sites you probably already knew
                existed. </p>
            <p>
                The software for this search engine is all custom-built, and all crawling and indexing is
                done in-house. The project is open source. Feel free to poke about in the <a
                    href="https://git.marginalia.nu/">source code</a> or contribute
                to the development!
            </p>
            <p>
                The search engine is currently serving about <tt>{{searchPerMinute}}</tt> queries/minute.
