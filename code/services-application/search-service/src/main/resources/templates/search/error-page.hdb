            <h1>Error</h1>
            <p>Oops! It appears the index server is <span class="headline">{{indexState}}</span>.</p>
            <p>The server was probably restarted to bring online some changes. Restarting the index typically takes
               a few minutes, during which searches can't be served. </p>

            <p>In the event of a longer outage, the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/MarginaliaNu">@marginalianu</a> feed
                on Twitter may have details, otherwise you can always send me an email at <tt>kontakt@marginalia.nu</tt>.</p>
