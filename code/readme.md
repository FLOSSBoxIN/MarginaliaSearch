# Code

This is a pretty large and diverse project with many moving parts. 

You'll find a short description in each module of what it does and how it relates to other modules.
The modules each have names like "library" or "process" or "feature".  These have specific meanings. 
See [doc/module-taxonomy.md](../doc/module-taxonomy.md).

## Overview

A map of the most important components and how they relate can be found below.

### Services
* [core services](services-core/) "macroservices", stateful, memory hungry doing heavy lifting.
* * [control-service](services-core/control-service)  
* * [search](services-core/search-service)
* * [index](services-core/index-service)
* * [assistant](services-core/assistant-service)
* [satellite services](services-satellite/) "microservices", stateless providing additional functionality.
* * [api](services-satellite/api-service)  - public API
* * [dating](services-satellite/dating-service)  - [https://explore.marginalia.nu/](https://explore.marginalia.nu/)
* * [explorer](services-satellite/explorer-service)  - [https://explore2.marginalia.nu/](https://explore2.marginalia.nu/)
* an [internal API](api/)

### Processes

Processes are batch jobs that deal with data retrieval, processing and loading.

* [processes](processes/)
* * [crawling-process](processes/crawling-process)
* * [converting-process](processes/converting-process)
* * [loading-process](processes/loading-process)

#### Tools

* * [crawl-job-extractor](tools/crawl-job-extractor)
* * [term-frequency-extractor](tools/term-frequency-extractor)

### Features

Features are relatively stand-alone components that serve some part of the domain. They aren't domain-independent,
but isolated. 

* [features-search](features-search)
* [features-crawl](features-crawl)
* [features-convert](features-convert)
* [features-index](features-index)

### Libraries and primitives

Libraries are stand-alone code that is independent of the domain logic.  

* [common](common/) elements for creating a service, a client etc.
* [libraries](libraries/) containing non-search specific code.
* * [array](libraries/array/) - large memory mapped area library 
* * [btree](libraries/btree/) - static btree library
