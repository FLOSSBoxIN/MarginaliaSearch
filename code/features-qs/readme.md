**Note**: This package is called `features-qs` rather than `features-query` because the latter,
though more consistent with other packages like features-index, would be very confusing
as there are other packages elsewhere with the 'query' name (e.g. features-index/index-query).

## Contents

* [query-parser](query-parser/) contains code for parsing the user-facing query grammar.
