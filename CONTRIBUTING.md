This is a bit of a special project,
in part because a search engine isn't
like a text editor that you can just
download and tinker with; and in part
because it's as much a research project
as it is a search engine.

If you have an idea for a cool change,
email <kontakt@marginalia.nu> and
we can discuss its feasibility.

Search is essentially a fractal of interesting
problems, so even if you don't have an idea,
just a skillset (really any), odds are there's
something interesting I could point you to.

Make sure you check out the [ide-configuration guide](doc/ide-configuration.md)
to get your IDE set up quickly and easily.
