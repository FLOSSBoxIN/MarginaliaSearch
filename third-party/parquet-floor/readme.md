# Parquet Floor

License: APL 2.0

Git: https://github.com/strategicblue/parquet-floor

It's basically an adaptor for Parquet I/O without
needing to pull half of Hadoop into your project.

The library has been modified with support for reading
and writing lists of values, and the default
compression has been altered to zstd.
